While this bill positions itself to fund programs like what we&#39;ve been working on with multiple cities across Colorado and even across the country, the funding is restricted to law enforcement agencies and there is other language that would further harm our efforts. Taking Denver and Aurora for example, two cities we&#39;ve worked with that have either launched or approved non-police models, neither city would theoretically be eligible for this funding for non-police models. Denver&#39;s STAR lives under Denver Department of Public Health and Environment and Aurora&#39;s program will live under a director position at the municipal level, outside of the police department. If these two programs are influencing this legislation, then the bill has fallen short of even supporting those cities, as well as others as there is tremendous nuance to each city we&#39;ve worked to create programs with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We ask our supporters and community to join us in opposing this bill as it has been written and invite folks to testify. You can do so virtually by signing up at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www2.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2021A/commsumm.nsf/signIn.xsp&#34;&gt;https://www2.leg.state.co.us/…/CLIC…/commsumm.nsf/signIn.xsp&lt;/a&gt;. At the very least, we ask that folks submit written testimony or contact their elected officials with the following demands: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Funding being open to entities that are not strictly law enforcement. If this bill is to support community partnerships, then funding must be open to the actual community partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Equal or majority funding going towards non-police models versus co-responder models. There should be a distinction between the two as they are not the same and while there has been some positive impact from co-responder programs, we have heard from social workers that they are often inhibited from doing their jobs by the commanding presence of law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Remove the required $2 million set aside for law enforcement mental health as that would leave almost nothing for crisis response programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Finally, if legislators are to work to support local programs that are community partnerships, then there should be more due diligence in engaging with the municipalities and community organizations doing the work before moving this bill forward in any form. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We believe that the state should help municipalities work to create non-police models that we&#39;ve been working on, especially as cities have continued to note funding as a barrier. However, we reject the limited confines of this particular bill and insist on more engagement from those working to introduce it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com&#34;&gt;See More&lt;/a&gt;</content>

Solidarity meals have been very successful to raise funds for individual families but that has sometimes meant the organization didn&#39;t have emergency funds to tap into if anyone was unexpectedly de...tained or in need of immediate legal representation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buy a burrito, it could mean someone gets out of a cage quicker, or has the representation they need to stay in the country and with their families!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Support by ordering at &lt;a href=&#34;https://solidaritymeals.paperform.co/&#34;&gt;https://solidaritymeals.paperform.co.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Pickup in Denver February 27, 1-3.

Ingrid &amp; Gaby are making burritos together to raise money for the emergency fund. It’s a lit...tle bit of money that we’re able to tap if anyone is unexpectedly detained or in need of immediate legal representation. The fund provides some peace of mind for everyone, because if something were to happen, there’s money to fall back on.

DEMAND AURORA RESPOND TO ELIJAH MCCLAIN INVESTIGATION FINDINGS**&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In light of the findings of the Aurora commissioned investigation into the death of Elijah McClain that was released yesterday, please join us in calling on the Aurora mayor, Police and Fire chiefs, City Council members, and Governor Polis to take accountability and act NOW. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WHY: The city officials have had 18 months to take appropriate measures in the firing of the involved individuals, as we...ll as file adequate charges. We have waited long enough. The findings are in. Our elected officials can wait no longer to show the public that there is no greater public safety issue than removing those responsible for murdering Elijah to address the continued risk they pose to the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOW: Using the top button on the “Justice for Elijah McClain” Linktree page, an email to the appropriate contacts will auto populate demanding justice for Elijah. (Please note all browsers populate differently and you may be required to edit for accuracy before sending.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GOAL: DSURJ’s goal is to generate at least 25 new emails by the end of the week to send a clear message to Aurora officials that the community is watching. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Comment below and let us know you’ve reached out, and please share! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://linktr.ee/Justiceforelijahmcclain&#34;&gt;https://linktr.ee/Justiceforelijahmcclain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/SURJDenver/posts/2829165917357563&#34;&gt;See More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://linktr.ee/Justiceforelijahmcclain&#34;&gt;Linktree.

We are posting the link to the report here for the general public’s review. To briefly summarize, it finds that upon review the evidence shows that:&lt;/p&gt;...&lt;p&gt; 1) Officers DID NOT have sufficient reason/cause to STOP Elijah McClain;&lt;br /&gt; 2) Officers DID NOT have sufficient reason/cause to FRISK Elijah McClain;&lt;br /&gt; 3) There was NOT SUFFICIENT CAUSE to support the PHYSICAL RESTRAINT of Elijah McClain;&lt;br /&gt; 4) The DECISION TO APPLY FORCE IN RESPONSE TO THE THREAT OR PERCEIVED THREAT that Elijah McClain reached for an officer’s gun during the struggle is NOT SUPPORTED BY THE EVIDENCE;&lt;br /&gt; 5) The record DOES NOT PROVIDE EVIDENCE of the officers’ perception of a threat that would justify consecutive carotid holds, which caused Elijah McClain to either partially or fully lose consciousness;&lt;br /&gt; 6) Officers’ assertions of the necessity of pain compliance techniques are IN CONTRAST to Elijah McClain’s audible statements while being restrained;&lt;br /&gt; 7) Aurora EMS DID NOT RENDER AID to Elijah McClain for several minutes after arrival and the body worn camera footage DOES NOT REFLECT any attempt by Aurora Fire to examine or question Elijah McClain before the administration of ketamine;&lt;br /&gt; 8.)THE DECISION TO ADMINISTER KETAMINE was made within 6 minutes of arrival when Aurora Fire deferred to the recommendation of officers WITHOUT MEANINGFUL OBSERVATION OR DIAGNOSTIC EXAMINATION;&lt;br /&gt; 9) Aurora EMS determined it was appropriate to administer ketamine to Elijah McClain despite the fact that HE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE OFFERING MEANINGFUL RESISTANCE in the presence of EMS personnel;&lt;br /&gt; 10) THE AMOUNT OF KETAMINE ADMINISTERED was based on a grossly inaccurate and inflated estimate of Elijah McClain’s weight, carrying a higher risk of sedation complications;&lt;br /&gt; 11) The Aurora PD’s AFTER-INCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS revealed SIGNIFICANT WEAKNESSES IN THE DEPARTMENT’S ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEMS, with investigative questioning that appeared designed to elicit specific exonerating “magic language” found in court rulings.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.auroragov.org/UserFiles/Servers/Server_1881137/File/News%20Items/Investigation%20Report%20and%20Recommendations%20(FINAL).pdf&#34;&gt;https://www.auroragov.org/…/Investigation%20Report%20and%20…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/SURJDenver/posts/2829164437357711&#34;&gt;See More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/SURJDenver/photos/a.1639607076313459/2829165054024316/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/152947677_2829165057357649_7873324528673537040_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&amp;ccb=3&amp;_nc_sid=8024bb&amp;_nc_ohc=RyeDIgARu9gAX8iSnEZ&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&amp;tp=6&amp;oh=3424cb80b108bdf28491b57cf7c50703&amp;oe=6064CFDD&#34; alt=&#34;May be an image of 1 person&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;282&#34; caption=&#34;May be an image of 1 person&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

While the vote was non-binding, he needs to hear from constituents that these decisions that hurt those most vulnerable to the pandemic will not be tolerated, bef...ore he does it again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sanctuary 4 All, a grassroots organization that advocates for the immigrant community in Colorado, has put out a call to action for Coloradans to voice their anger over Hickenlooper’s vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WHY: Coloradans elected Senator Hickenlooper to support everyone, regardless of their legal status. He needs to know that this is an unacceptable position to take and that we will hold him accountable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOW: Call Senator Hickenlooper today at 202-224-5941 to let him know that everyone deserves relief from the COVID-19 pandemic and that his actions matter to the people of Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAMPLE SCRIPT:&lt;br /&gt; My name is [FULL NAME] and I live in [COMMUNITY/ZIP CODE].&lt;br /&gt; I am calling because I am deeply disturbed by Senator Hickenlooper’s vote to block undocumented families from receiving COVID relief checks. Everyone in Colorado and around the country deserves support during this pandemic, especially immigrant communities that can be even more vulnerable. As his constituent, I will continue to hold Hickenlooper accountable for all of his votes and demand that he support immigrant families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GOAL: DSURJ’s goal is to generate at least 20 calls by the end of the weekend to send a clear message to Hickenlooper that we are watching each and every one of his votes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Comment below to let us know you&#39;ve reached out and please share!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/SURJDenver/posts/2816757975265024&#34;&gt;See More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/Sanctuary4AllCO/photos/a.2370326513256268/2846031305685784/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/147440948_2846031309019117_1878428333945520111_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&amp;ccb=3&amp;_nc_sid=110474&amp;_nc_ohc=pWhu6SYpi4kAX-4rF93&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&amp;tp=6&amp;oh=4e2e416716cba8bd88762c4e5ec84473&amp;oe=6067501E&#34; alt=&#34;May be an image of 1 person and outdoors&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; caption=&#34;May be an image of 1 person and outdoors&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/Sanctuary4AllCO/&#34;&gt;Sanctuary4All Colorado&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/Sanctuary4AllCO/photos/a.2370326513256268/2846031305685784/&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emergency call Today Senator Hickenlooper has started a bad journey in his role by giving his back to the immigrant community. By voting no on COVID relief chec...ks for immigrant families that have no sort of economic support from our government. Clearly he does not care now that he has a home, he has food, he has medical insurance, a secure salary that his citizens pay including tax paying immigrants. His decisions harm a large number of people in Colorado and that is unacceptable. Call his office in Washington and let him know that his decision was one of the biggest mistakes he could’ve made. 202-224-5941. We hope that he supports all his citizens in Colorado but also at a national level regardless of their legal status. The immigrant community in this pandemic is the most vulnerable in not being able to receive federal aid. Call and ask your acquaintances to show their indignation and anger upon this decision.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com&#34;&gt;See More&lt;/a&gt;</content>
