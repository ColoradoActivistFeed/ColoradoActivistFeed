    <title>Statement on Saturday&#39;s Counter Protest</title>
    <updated>2020-10-12T13:32:27-06:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/j9xr9z/statement_on_saturdays_counter_protest/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;md&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, October 10th, the Denver Communists, W.I.T.C.H. Denver, the Front Range Mutual Aid Network, Colorado Socialist Revolution, and others held a rally to oppose and confront a fascist militia gathering. Canned and dry foods were collected and hot meals were cooked and served. We also set up tables under canopies to facilitate political conversation, distribute Marxist literature, and invite the people we meet to organize with us to grow the anti-racist, anti-fascist movement. By midafternoon all of our goals had been accomplished--most importantly our counter protest had outnumbered, drowned out, and driven off the fascist rally. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the ‘patriots’ shuffled off in defeat, a little over an hour after their assembly began, one of them struck, maced, and was subsequently shot and killed by another person. The best information we have is that the shooter was a Pinkerton security contractor employed by 9News, the local NBC affiliate. It has also come out that the person who was killed had violently attacked a Black Lives Matter protestor last summer and was aggressively confronting a Black man moments before the shooting. While we support the right to self-defense and encourage emancipatory collective self-defense independent of the capitalist state by the working class and the oppressed, we believe that our best defense is built with mass organization, not by individual acts of violence. Throughout the history of fascist and far-right organizing, mass movements of oppressed working class people mobilized to oppose them. This has proven to be the most effective, unequivocal and powerful solution. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our experience on Saturday bears this out. Without firing a shot, or even connecting with a soup can, we were able to effectively repel the gathering of III%ers, Oath Keepers, Proud Boys, and other white nationalists, while building closer contacts with other workers looking to organize against racism, fascism, and capitalism more broadly. Some media outlets reporting on the event, including the one who employed the alleged shooter, imply that the Denver Communists and others involved in opposing the far-right gathering were responsible for the shooting. This isn’t just incorrect, it inverts the situation entirely--had they been able to assemble without our opposition, the militia-fascists would have felt more empowered to exercise violence, not less. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The police don’t do anything to stand against fascist violence-- not on Saturday nor this entire summer of mass uprising, not to speak of the historical camaraderie between cops and fascists. We’ve seen them work hand-in-hand with the armed right wing in Kenosha, Portland, and Minneapolis. It’s no different here in Denver where even when the police aren’t directly coordinating with militias and white-nationalist groups they’re always ready to defend them. On Saturday, while we fed the hungry with soup and communist politics, it was no coincidence that the police were facing our rally and kept their backs turned to the armed vigilantes behind them. We can’t rely on the state to oppose reactionary politics. Instead we seek to organize masses of workers to protect ourselves, our communities, and each other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If we recognize that our power to combat fascism comes from masses organized against it, that also means that our orientation needs to be to the public. While we acknowledge the importance of security and safeguarding those involved in organizing with us, we believe that many have mistaken obscurity with security. Instead, the Denver Communists are committed to organizing publicly, openly, and confidently. We don’t see any other way to grow the large, combative social movements that are necessary to fight the increasingly deadly status quo. After the success of the BLM-Antifa Soup Drive, we look forward to confronting the far right again the next time they rear their ugly heads. We encourage anyone interested in getting involved to attend our next meeting, over Zoom this Wednesday, where we’ll discuss our approach to organizing against the far right.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/user/denversocialists&#34;&gt; /u/denversocialists &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/j9xr9z/statement_on_saturdays_counter_protest/&#34;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/j9xr9z/statement_on_saturdays_counter_protest/&#34;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

Canned and dry foods were collected and hot meals were cooked and served. We also set up tables under canopies to facilitate political conversation, distribute Marxist literature, and invite the people we meet to organize with us to grow the anti-racist, anti-fascist movement. By mid-afternoon all of our goals had been accomplished--most importantly our counter protest had outnumbered, drowned out, and driven off the fascist rally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As the ‘patriots’ shuffled off in defeat, a little over an hour after their assembly began, one of them struck, maced, and was subsequently shot and killed by another person. The best information we have is that the shooter was a Pinkerton security contractor employed by 9News, the local NBC affiliate. It has also come out that the person who was killed had violently attacked a Black Lives Matter protestor last summer and was aggressively confronting a Black man moments before the shooting. While we support the right to self-defense and encourage emancipatory collective self-defense independent of the capitalist state by the working class and the oppressed, we believe that our best defense is built with mass organization, not by individual acts of violence. Throughout the history of fascist and far-right organizing, mass movements of oppressed working class people mobilized to oppose them. This has proven to be the most effective, unequivocal and powerful solution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our experience on Saturday bears this out. Without firing a shot, or even connecting with a soup can, we were able to effectively repel the gathering of III%ers, Oath Keepers, Proud Boys, and other white nationalists, while building closer contacts with other workers looking to organize against racism, fascism, and capitalism more broadly. Some media outlets reporting on the event, including the one who employed the alleged shooter, imply that the Denver Communists and others involved in opposing the far-right gathering were responsible for the shooting. This isn’t just incorrect, it inverts the situation entirely--had they been able to assemble without our opposition, the militia-fascists would have felt more empowered to exercise violence, not less. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The police don’t do anything to stand against fascist violence-- not on Saturday nor this entire summer of mass uprising, not to speak of the historical camaraderie between cops and fascists. We’ve seen them work hand-in-hand with the armed right wing in Kenosha, Portland, and Minneapolis. It’s no different here in Denver where even when the police aren’t directly coordinating with militias and white-nationalist groups they’re always ready to defend them. On Saturday, while we fed the hungry with soup and communist politics, it was no coincidence that the police were facing our rally and kept their backs turned to the armed vigilantes behind them. We can’t rely on the state to oppose reactionary politics. Instead we seek to organize masses of workers to protect ourselves, our communities, and each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If we recognize that our power to combat fascism comes from masses organized against it, that also means that our orientation needs to be to the public. While we acknowledge the importance of security and safeguarding those involved in organizing with us, we believe that many have mistaken obscurity with security. Instead, the Denver Communists are committed to organizing publicly, openly, and confidently. We don’t see any other way to grow the large, combative social movements that are necessary to fight the increasingly deadly status quo. After the success of the BLM-Antifa Soup Drive, we look forward to confronting the far right again the next time they rear their ugly heads. We encourage anyone interested in getting involved to attend our next meeting, over Zoom this Wednesday, where we’ll discuss our approach to organizing against the far right.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com&#34;&gt;See More&lt;/a&gt;</content>

As we bear witness to the pervasive racism that continues to plague our criminal legal system, we must confront the stark realities of racialized policing in... our society.  We must reimagine our system of police violence and mistrust and replace it with alternative, civilian-led services that ensure public safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Join us for the second of a three-part webinar series as we discuss the origins of policing and why calls for reform are not enough to eliminate discriminatory enforcement practices, how we must redirect resources from draconian police departments to services that are responsive to addressing our neighbors’ needs, and how advocates can demand revolutionary change from their local officials that promotes community safety without the dependence of law enforcement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a community we must move beyond a system of policing, caging and punishment to keep our neighbors safe by reimagining solutions and interventions that promote dignity, anti-racism, and freedom from the fear of state-sanctioned violence.&#34;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/AbolishICEDenver/posts/701506147125632&#34;&gt;See More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s526x296/120190282_3595613673805429_2067126571110067540_o.jpg?_nc_cat=107&amp;_nc_sid=b386c4&amp;_nc_ohc=_D9CnARA_KAAX_qDYyy&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&amp;tp=7&amp;oh=35337efd7f53e948e49feb73675376f6&amp;oe=5FA9022E&#34; alt=&#34;ACLU of Colorado&#39;s photo.&#34; width=&#34;504&#34; height=&#34;263&#34; caption=&#34;ACLU of Colorado&#39;s photo.&#34; /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/events/386163085741607/&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;THU, OCT 15 AT 12:00 PM MDT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Divest From Police.

Previously the City Council President has approved an IPD proclamation but that was just a 1 day declaration each year. This resolution means this is now a done deal in Colorado Springs! Kateri Kerwin, Navajo Nation, LCSW and co-chair of the Native Advisory Council will be doing the invocation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Due to COVID restrictions we are not able to go inside but the meeting will be live streamed. We will meet outside of city hall to give our loudest lilililililis or lulululus when the vote passes. We asked that they make sure the windows are open so they can hear us! We will then take a celebratory walk to the MMIW mural (just a couple blocks away) and spread our Indigenousness all over downtown. Masks required to keep our relatives safe! &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Allies &amp;amp; accomplices welcome! But you better bring your people&amp;#39;s version of a lilili too!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Type of Event:&lt;/em&gt; Rally&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;h3&gt;October 17&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:00 PM - 4:00 PM&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/events/2721901238065765&#34;&gt;COS Black&amp;amp;Pink Card Writing in Solidarity&lt;/a&gt; (Facebook event)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Organized by:&lt;/em&gt; Colorado No More Prisons&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Location:&lt;/em&gt; Chinook Center (2551 Airport Rd #107, Colorado Springs, CO)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Host-provided information:&lt;/em&gt; Join the Colorado Springs chapter of Black and Pink for solidarity and birthday card writing to LGBTQ prisoners in Colorado!

We will be taking some time to figure out how we can all best move forward with our advocacy work. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mission Statement: The Denver Solidarity Rides are hosted by a collective of cyclists in the Mile High City. We use the bicycle as a vehicle for protest to call attention to the violence disproportionately affecting Black people and people of color at the hands of police in America.

But in Colorado, that access is under a real, imminent threat: Proposition 115, a measure that would ban abortion later in pregnancy is on the ballot this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is all Coloradans are asking for: to control our own bodies, and our own futures. With Justice Ginsburg now gone, it falls on all of us to honor her legacy by continuing that fight.

Who is going to bring charges against him for cruel and inhumane treatment of our homeless? The DA he appointed? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hancok is on the hook for violating a settlement with the homeless community that the city signed with the federal gov&#39;t. The judge who heard all the initial testimony is likely to be very pissed about the city&#39;s behavior. Expect consequences from the Feds for the violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/120553547_1746580842168424_1453564151711486355_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&amp;_nc_sid=f2c4d5&amp;_nc_ohc=cy8QiH-tXBkAX9jYBct&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&amp;oh=c4d879e285ab6b6489e23046b16fe76f&amp;oe=5FAA477E&#34; /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/unicornriot.ninja/&#34;&gt;Unicorn Riot&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/unicornriot.ninja/&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/unicornriot.ninja/videos/1746560145503827/&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Denver, CO - Starting on Tuesday, October 6, the city of Denver conducted a massive three-day multi-agency sweep displacing around 200 tent residents. The sweep... began at 14th Ave and Logan St ending at 14th Ave and N Clarkson St on Thursday. &lt;br /&gt; Every morning around 2:30am a metal chainlink fence was built around the targeted encampment. The police, the private-contracted clean-up company Environmental Hazmat Services, the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure (formerly public works), and more, showed up around 5:30 each morning forcing the residents to pack-up and move. When our local reporter and community members asked the police multiple times where the residents could move to, they said they didn&#39;t know. &lt;br /&gt; On Monday, before the three-day sweep began, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Denver, Mayor Michael Hancock, CO Governor Jared Polis, Environmental Hazmat Services, and multiple police officers and state troopers for violating constitutional rights of unhoused individuals, and violating the agreed upon settlement from Lyall v City of Denver during these ongoing sweeps. The lawsuit was filed by Andrew McNaulty of Killmer, Lane and Newman, LLP on behalf of Denver Homeless Out Loud, 10 unhoused individuals, and all others similarly situated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stay tuned for updates and more media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you appreciate our coverage, please consider supporting us: &lt;a href=&#34;https://unicornriot.ninja/donate/&#34;&gt;https://unicornriot.ninja/donate/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com&#34;&gt;See More&lt;/a&gt;</content>

    <title>Ideas and volunteers needed: Colorado Activism Hub</title>
    <updated>2020-10-09T10:28:06-06:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/j825zd/ideas_and_volunteers_needed_colorado_activism_hub/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;md&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many of you, we have been feeling the need for better organization and information dissemination around activism in Colorado. After discussing with comrades and thinking this over, we think that something like a community activism hub would be really valuable and, if well designed and maintained, would fill many of the needs that aren&amp;#39;t currently being well met. Below is a list of requirements/components for the hub. We&amp;#39;re thinking that a website would be the best platform, but am open to other suggestions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what we need from you: * If you or someone you know has tech expertise and can volunteer time to help design and implement this idea, please DM me. * We will also need volunteers to help generate content and monitor/maintain the site...kind of like the reddit mod role.&lt;br/&gt; * Lastly, if you would like to add to or change any of the requirements, please leave a comment below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We help us, let&amp;#39;s make this happen!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;List of requirements/components for Colorado Activism Hub: - Searchable, taggable calendar of events (events ideally would be well-formatted and each have a risk rating) - Ability for members of the public to submit events for inclusion in the hub calendar - Searchable database of organizations and groups, with a page for each organization - List of causes (such as BLM, homelessness, LGBTQIA, etc.) - List of active fundraisers and drives, with the ability for members of the public to submit fundraisers for approval - List of ways to help (mutual aid, donating, letter-writing, etc) - Beginner&amp;#39;s guide to protesting, mutual aid, etc. - List of educational resources - Twitter RSS feed for key organizers in the Denver area, and relevant hashtags&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/user/denverprotestsdaily&#34;&gt; /u/denverprotestsdaily &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/j825zd/ideas_and_volunteers_needed_colorado_activism_hub/&#34;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/j825zd/ideas_and_volunteers_needed_colorado_activism_hub/&#34;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

This... was the SECOND nighttime raid in recent months at the humanitarian aid station. 12 people were arrested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Border Patrol, with BORTAC, stormed the camp in full tactical gear, with night vision goggles and guns drawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For 3 hours, a helicopter buzzed overhead, kicking up plumes of dust &amp; terrorizing the migrants they chased &amp; arrested in the darkness. This is a particularly insidious tactic BP uses to frighten &amp; disorient people. It often results in death and disappearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It&#39;s called &#34;dusting&#34; and it happens everyday in the desert.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com&#34;&gt;See More&lt;/a&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;md&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Comrades,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With what is shaping up to be a potentially dangerous weekend thanks to all the raging fascists, it might be good to share some ideas to make sure everyone returns home just as safely as they left. I&amp;#39;ll leave a couple bullets below but please contribute as you see fit:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dont wear any of the same clothes, shoes, hairstyles you did at previous events (cough* Back the Blue). Cameras are everywhere and Cops and Chuds &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; try to identify/connect/doxx you to past events. Cover those tattoos!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you bring soup to feed some families, your fingerprints will be on them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you feel the need to record/upload, make sure you blur out comrades faces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure theres a million others. Hopefully I can make it this weekend. Love you all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/user/Aegon_Targs_Uncle&#34;&gt; /u/Aegon_Targs_Uncle &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/j7eyx9/weekend_protest_safety_thread/&#34;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/j7eyx9/weekend_protest_safety_thread/&#34;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

Some residents of this camp at 19th and Welton shared with us today how they were kicked out of the Samaritan House Family shelter for having “stayed their time” and, after calling all other family shelters and signing up for section 8 lottery, they are now on ...the streets with no other options of where to go. (See interview here &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/videos/805786780232130/&#34;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/videos/805786780232130&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moving people who have nowhere to go with no answer does not work. It is time we start using our brains and our hearts, instead of continuing this shameful whack-a-mole. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Contact City Council to ask for support for our budget proposals for housing and sanitation resources. &lt;a href=&#34;https://denverhomelessoutloud.org/2020/10/07/denver-budget-proposals-2021/&#34;&gt;https://denverhomelessoutloud.org/…/denver-budget-proposal…/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Please come and support our unhoused community members at 19th and Welton and support residents of this encampment as they demand real housing or places where they are allowed to survive.&lt;br /&gt; Bring the following things to assist residents:&lt;br /&gt; -Truck, or any vehicle to help move&lt;br /&gt; -Carts&lt;br /&gt; -Bungee Cords/Rope&lt;br /&gt; -Trash Bags&lt;br /&gt; -Food&lt;br /&gt; -Coffee/CoCo&lt;br /&gt; -Water&lt;br /&gt; Your assistance is much appreciated!

He has received two commend...ations for preventing prison riots. He has raised money for the children’s fund, was office manager of the computer lab and a teacher’s aide for GED classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jalil is also the recipient of several certificates for rehabilitation programming, and is a published author, poet, educator and blogger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a human rights advocate, he had the first U.S. prisoners national petition heard and recorded by a Special Committee at the United Nations on U.S. prisons and the existence of U.S. political prisoners.

Stand firm sisters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We have for generations kept secrets, swallowed lies, tolerated the intolerable for fear of what would come should we simply speak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Well, let the words come. Let them flow like the Jordan River. Spit fire with each syllable. Let the phrases burn down the walls that have caged you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Be free. Be healed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then promise to never betray yourself with silence again. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/blackhistorybootcamp&#34;&gt;#BlackHistoryBootcamp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com&#34;&gt;See More&lt;/a&gt;</content>

She is heard saying she can’t breathe, just like Elijah McClain, George Floyd, Eric Garner and so many others. APD Chief Vanessa Wilson has claimed that had Shataean died in the patrol car Officer Huffine would be in jail. So there&#39;s only a crime if someone dies? How can we trust the same Chief Wilson who refuses to fire the killer cops who murdered Elijah McClain and 17th District Attorney Dave Young who refuses to press murder charges against them? Dave Young would rather press kidnapping charges against activists for organizing protests demanding Justice for Elijah McClain, which gained international attention, than press charges against violent cops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://denver.cbslocal.com/2020/09/29/shataean-kelly-levi-huffine-aurora-police-video-released-woman-struggling-back-patrol-car/&#34;&gt;Aurora&#39;s chief said bodycam video appears to show one of her former officers, Levi Huffine, &#34;punishing&#34; a female prisoner.&lt;img src=&#34;https://external.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQCFhLQBHJzZwbih&amp;w=540&amp;h=282&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdenver.cbslocal.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F15909806%2F2020%2F09%2Fvideo-aurora-police.jpg%3Fw%3D1500&amp;cfs=1&amp;upscale=1&amp;fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&amp;_nc_cb=1&amp;_nc_hash=AQDM_MSXWOqk1PAB&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;262&#34; caption=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;denver.cbslocal.com|By &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/CBSDenver/&#34;&gt;CBS Denver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aurora Police Video Released Of Woman Cuffed, Hogtied In Back Of Patrol Car: &#39;Please Don&#39;t Let Me Die Back Here&#39;&lt;/p&gt;Aurora&#39;s chief said bodycam video appears to show one of her former officers, Levi Huffine, &#34;punishing&#34; a female prisoner.&lt;a href=&#34;https://denver.cbslocal.com/2020/09/29/shataean-kelly-levi-huffine-aurora-police-video-released-woman-struggling-back-patrol-car/&#34;&gt;Aurora&#39;s chief said bodycam video appears to show one of her former officers, Levi Huffine, &#34;punishing&#34; a female prisoner.&lt;/a&gt;</content>

These two comrades showed immense bravery in coming and speaking out against the injustice and cruelty of the criminal justice system, which they’ve now experienced firsthand. Joel would have absolutely been there too if he didn...&#39;t have to be out of town! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite the incredibly difficult experience of going through jail and facing the upcoming battle to drop the over 30 serious charges that these organizers collectively face, they have not been intimidated by the repressive and violent forces of DPD, APD, and the 18th and 17th district attorneys. Their resolve has only been made stronger against the injustice that they and all prisoners and victims of police violence face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lillian spoke about the meaning of solidarity, telling the crowd how Eliza told her lawyer that if bond was posted for her before Lillian, she would insist on staying in jail despite the horrible torturous conditions she faced until Lillian was released too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eliza spoke of the need to continue the struggle against police terror now more than ever, saying &#34;Let it be known - they wouldn&#39;t come after us if this movement didn&#39;t SCARE them!&#34; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The battle to drop the charges is only beginning and everyone in the movement must come together in solidarity at this time to challenge an enemy with more resources but not more numbers, an enemy that uses the power of violence but is no match for the power of the people! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the words of Assata Shakur: “We must love and support one another, we have nothing to lose but our chains!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And in the words of Lillian House: “Our determination is so much greater than our fear. Our solidarity is so much greater than the repression. I have never felt more confident that we have what it takes to go the distance. WE WILL WIN&#34;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1039416439844179&#34;&gt;See More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1039416439844179/1040214076431082/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/120344997_1040214079764415_2592424513991444533_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&amp;_nc_sid=110474&amp;_nc_ohc=TLBKEY19gr4AX9YSmBf&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&amp;tp=6&amp;oh=bd79e68b2e05fe6720582c28d2b1e569&amp;oe=5FA87951&#34; alt=&#34;Image may contain: 1 person, standing&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;376&#34; caption=&#34;Image may contain: 1 person, standing&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1039416439844179/1040214233097733/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p235x165/120442612_1040214239764399_7821939980886648424_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&amp;_nc_sid=110474&amp;_nc_ohc=q0U41QQ6ISsAX-kE5p6&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&amp;tp=6&amp;oh=c4a9cbab2c6105e5a031d1894b215857&amp;oe=5FAACF94&#34; alt=&#34;Image may contain: 1 person, standing and outdoor&#34; width=&#34;293&#34; height=&#34;165&#34; caption=&#34;Image may contain: 1 person, standing and outdoor&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1039416439844179/1040214213097735/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p235x165/120338934_1040214216431068_4229693215610610667_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&amp;_nc_sid=110474&amp;_nc_ohc=9JK7qx-nr4UAX9ZVBaj&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&amp;tp=6&amp;oh=e577f97a3b80006c0534fcbee07bdf0c&amp;oe=5FAA42D0&#34; alt=&#34;Image may contain: 3 people, people standing and outdoor&#34; width=&#34;293&#34; height=&#34;165&#34; caption=&#34;Image may contain: 3 people, people standing and outdoor&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1039416439844179/1040214086431081/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p235x165/120371184_1040214089764414_157915028763270256_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&amp;_nc_sid=110474&amp;_nc_ohc=sZFUTlHZxhoAX9lpasx&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&amp;tp=6&amp;oh=766dacd308be0ac2b5afaede3678285e&amp;oe=5FA9C58D&#34; alt=&#34;Image may contain: one or more people, crowd and outdoor&#34; width=&#34;293&#34; height=&#34;165&#34; caption=&#34;Image may contain: one or more people, crowd and outdoor&#34; /&gt;+4&lt;/a&gt;</content>

We demand their immediate freedom and that the charges against them be dropped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Sept. 17, several protest leaders, including four members of the Party for Socialism and Liberation, were arrested in Denver, Colorado in a coordinated police attack. The org...anizers now face over 30 bogus charges including “kidnapping” and “inciting a riot,” and potentially years in prison. They were targeted because of their dedicated organizing efforts in recent months to denouncing the police murder of Elijah McClain in Aurora, Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The same District Attorney, Dave Young, who has refused to charge the police officers who murdered Elijah McClain, directed these felony arrests of the organizers who have been protesting against him. He is engaged in a corrupt abuse of his authority to silence his critics and the demands for racial justice, a declaration of war against the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This attack goes hand in hand with the assault on the anti-racist movement directed from the White House, from Governor’s mansions, and from local police departments around the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We understand that this can happen to any protester, who has used their voice to mobilize in the mass movement against racism in every single corner of the United States. We stand united against this attack on civil liberties and the ongoing movement for Black Lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Demands:&lt;br /&gt; Free the anti-racist organizers from jail immediately!&lt;br /&gt; Drop all the charges!&lt;br /&gt; Stop the assault on the movement and on free speech!&lt;br /&gt; In solidarity,&lt;br /&gt; Add your name here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pslweb.org/denverorgsolidarity&#34;&gt;https://www.pslweb.org/denverorgsolidarity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/SURJDenver/posts/2706885716252251&#34;&gt;See More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pslweb.org/denverorgsolidarity&#34;&gt;We are calling on all individuals and organizations who care about justice and free speech to unite in this fight to defend the protest movement, and free these Denver-area organizers.

This site was posted for a sweep the same day as residents from 25th and Arapahoe moved to this site in search of anywhere to be. 25th and Welton is currently home to another 60 or so people without housing. Most of the residents on the right of way strip on 25th have been living there for many months. Others living in the parking lot area have moved there recently after other sweeps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Residents of these encampments all ask the same question: where are we supposed to go?? The City has done nothing to get these people access to housing. They are not even being offered hotel rooms through the COVID FEMA funding. They are being told to either go to a shelter or go to jail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Come support residents of these encampments as they demand real housing or places where they are allowed to survive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bring the following things to assist residents: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; -Truck, or any vehicle to help move&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; -Carts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; -Bungee Cords/Rope&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; -Trash Bags&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; -Food&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; -Coffee/CoCo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; -Water&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Your assistance is much appreciated! Somewhere around 7am and all morning help will likely be needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Toward Rights, Dignity and Housing…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com&#34;&gt;See More&lt;/a&gt;</content>

Their civil rights are also being violated with Denver, Adams and Arapahoe County working together to deny our comrades a bond hearing. Our comrades suffer yet they are still thinking of others &amp;mdash; constantly telling communjty about the conditions of their cell mates and others in the jail and agitating for their release as well. @justiceforelijahmcclain PSL Denver and Say Their Names 5280 are heroes and freedom fighters. And we need to be fighting harder than ever for them.  See you Saturday!</content>

As they have done all summer, members of the PSL and Frontline Party for Revolutionary Action and Denver S...chool Board Director Tay Anderson told the protestors to go home before 9pm. Most complied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those who stayed gathered for some speeches and faced off with a hostile driver. The driver ended up plowing into the crowd and was briefly detained by police two blocks away. No one was injured. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then we marched to the District 6 police station. Cops shot tear gas and protestors lobbed the canisters back at them. With our numbers so diminished, we were unable to maintain the march against police attack. Hastily-constructed dumpster barricades were no match for the truckloads of riot cops that shot pepperballs at us until we finally dispersed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Justice for Breonna Taylor will not be won by compliance with the system that murdered her!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com&#34;&gt;See More&lt;/a&gt;</content>

That day, APD also tried to make our indigenous comrades drop their prayer sticks to enter on Oakland Street and when our comrades told APD, &amp;quot;You&#39;re in riot gear and have batons! Let us have our prayer sticks or we are gonna sue the shit out of you!&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&#xA;&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;Why does APD continue to do private security for Aurora GEO?

Yesterday, several organizers from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/&#34;&gt;Party for Socialism and Liberation - Denver&lt;/a&gt; and Frontline Party for Revolution...ary Action were arrested on trumped up charges including kidnapping due to occupation OF A BUILDING. Yet Elijah’s killers and the individuals who drove their Jeep through a crowd of protesters have yet to see repercussions for their actions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Join us Saturday at noon to demand these charges be dropped and that the real criminals, the murderers of Elijah McClain, be held accountable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/SURJDenver/posts/2700168950257261&#34;&gt;See More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/119884024_1031612023957954_8730130592584893132_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&amp;_nc_sid=b386c4&amp;_nc_ohc=nOZSM2TY4ZwAX8tR4jR&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&amp;tp=6&amp;oh=3bb4d7ddbc47b63d9219ae255227b628&amp;oe=5FAB5666&#34; alt=&#34;Party for Socialism and Liberation - Denver&#39;s photo.&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;282&#34; caption=&#34;Party for Socialism and Liberation - Denver&#39;s photo.&#34; /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/events/637954907116841/&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAT, SEP 19&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drop the Charges!

People were arrested in a Home Depot parking lot, at their homes, and after they were pulled over while driving. Those arrested were the leaders to demand justice for Elijah McClain, who was brutally murdered by the Aurora Police Department. They are still in jail, with the exception of ...one person. They are facing multiple felony charges and years in prison in an obvious frame-up aimed at stopping the movement for justice for Elijah McClain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Add your name to sign the petition and join the campaign to demand that all the charges be dropped! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Petition text:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &#34;I demand that all charges be dropped on anti-racist organizers in the Denver area. It is an obvious political frame-up aimed at stopping the movement for justice for Elijah McClain.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can also donate for legal and political support for the PSL organizers who were arrested: &lt;a href=&#34;http://pslweb.org/donate4denver&#34;&gt;pslweb.org/donate4denver&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you are a community leader or a member of an organization you can sign our solidarity statement: &lt;a href=&#34;http://pslweb.org/denverorgsolidarity&#34;&gt;pslweb.org/denverorgsolidarity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you can support in person, you can join our emergency demonstration demanding the dropping off all charges: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/events/775179416359489/&#34;&gt;https://facebook.com/events/s/dropthechargesco-march-and-ral/775179416359489/?ti=icl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1031235080662315&#34;&gt;See More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pslweb.org/dropthecharges&#34;&gt;On Sept. 17, police agencies in the Denver area arrested anti-racist organizers in a coordinated assault.

We will defend our communities.&lt;br /&gt; We envision this Day of Rage to be decentralized, filled with creative direct action (both above ground and below ground), daring, and with extraordinary diversity of tactics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This could look like marches, occupations, blockades, street theater, it could look like anti-colonial messages spray painted on walls, it could look like monuments falling or going after resource colonial corporations and their machinery. It could look like hundreds of people or just a couple of people with a targeted action. What it looks like is really up to you. Check out our site for organizing resources for more info.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Organize and list or find an action here: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.indigenouspeoplesdayofrage.org/&#34;&gt;www.indigenouspeoplesdayofrage.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/indigenouspeoplesdayofrage&#34;&gt;#indigenouspeoplesdayofrage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/indigenouspeoplesday&#34;&gt;#indigenouspeoplesday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com&#34;&gt;See More&lt;/a&gt;</content>

Naturally, this was an extremely traumatizing event, and I preferred to spare the details from the world partly for privacy but mostly for shame. What they did to me was not only cruel and unusual, but I would even go so far as to call those men’s actions that night pure evil. But tonight I am forced to share with you all this in hopes you will stand in solidarity with me as I stand trial against felony charges that could land me years in prison. It would mean the world to me if you all could take a few minutes to read this and repost my story if you feel comfortable with that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The reason I feel forced to share my story, or even share prematurely is because of the circumstances of this trial. The night of the protest I was arrested for “disarming a peace officer” - they say I stole a pepper ball gun from one of the officers. Disclaimer, I didn&#39;t… but I’ll get to that later - After being discharged from jail due to my deteriorating medical condition, I quickly found an excellent law firm to help represent me. Over the next 4 weeks, my legal team visited DPD twice a day, requesting all the evidence such as footage from a street surveillance camera, and the officer&#39;s body cams. When they did not comply, I turned to my friends in the political realm. After a few state legislators reached out on my behalf, for the most part we were met with silence. As privileged as I was to have these politicians advocating for me, DPD still would not budge. The only discovery presented by the police so far, 6 weeks after my arrest, is a probable cause statement-making claims that can be quickly and easily disproved by a video of the arrest that night, provided by a fellow protestor. In all the years my lawyers have been practicing in Colorado, they have never once seen evidence be withheld to such a degree. And with all the stories of shady arrests going down, it is honestly starting to scare me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, now I know what a panic attack feels like. I now know the tight squeezing feeling that grips my chest, that the doctors call anxiety. The fact that I can&#39;t live without an irrational fear of being outside alone at night (something women have ALWAYS to deal with!!!!). The reason for this is because of the exact way the arrest went down that night. It was without any warning nor any chance to cooperate. I was grabbed from behind while I was standing, leaning against a fence. What happened next occurred in the blink of an eye. I was thrown to the ground face first. All of a sudden I started getting beaten by several officers, kicked and hit with a baton. I was grabbed by the hair on my scalp, my head was lifted off the ground, and I was punched multiple times in the face. My muffled screams for my girlfriend, for any help, were quickly snuffed out. Then an officer decided to take his baton, and forcibly shove it into my rectum. My “fight or flight, friend or freeze” instincts kicked in, and my body went numb. Everything that happened after that felt like a blur. I begged and pleaded for them to tell me what I had done wrong and why I was being arrested, but the only response I received was being told “We don’t gotta tell you SHIT… shut the FUCK up”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After spending the night in the hospital concussed and handcuffed to my gurney, I was finally thrown in jail. The worst of my charges: disarming an officer??? and violently resisting arrest?!? All absolutely untrue. I did not do it, and there is a video that shows all of this. My deepest gratitude goes out to the unnamed protestor who reached out with the video. I am not a violent man. Peace is my first language, anyone who knows me can tell you that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These officers must face the law. I still don&#39;t even know the names of my assaulters. They remain anonymous, STILL ON DUTY. How long until they sexually assault another victim, or even murder someone. How long until another “hashtag”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Please share this. If you feel comfortable, even share a short story, or some time you have personally witnessed the amount of love I pour into activism, and this community… I live to help. Tag Jared Polis. Tag Mayor Hancock. Tag DA Beth Mccann, DPD, tag em all. Community, I need you all now more than ever. I love you all. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to video of arrest: &lt;a href=&#34;https://streamable.com/3pn8wa&#34;&gt;https://streamable.com/3pn8wa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com&#34;&gt;See More&lt;/a&gt;</content>

Black men is unacceptable. Property can be replaced, Black Lives cannot,&#34; she maintains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “The arrests are violent, resulting in broken bones and other serious injuries. The criminal charges are being inflated to increasingly serious offenses. Protesters are being forced to risk their safety and freedom in order to exercise their right to free speech,&#34; said Jessica Jones — a local criminal defense attorney and volunteer organizer for the Colorado NLG. &#34;It is a sad paradox that protesters experience police violence as they protest police violence.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition to violent policing tactics in the name of crowd-control, Denver Police recently began invoking a little-used ordinance that was originally passed in anticipation of the 2008 Democratic National Convention protests. The law bans activists from carrying protective equipment, chains, and bike locks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &#34;This ordinance has allowed police to criminalize activists before a protest has even started,&#34; said Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.westword.com/news/denver-protest-arrests-likened-to-minority-report-11797388&#34;&gt;https://www.westword.com/…/denver-protest-arrests-likened-t…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php&#34;&gt;See More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.westword.com/news/denver-protest-arrests-likened-to-minority-report-11797388&#34;&gt;Possession of a helmet can allegedly lead to an arrest.&lt;img src=&#34;https://external.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDOHMSP4BLR8TPy&amp;w=540&amp;h=282&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages1.westword.com%2Fimager%2Fu%2Foriginal%2F11798121%2Fprotest_may30_eps_02.jpg&amp;cfs=1&amp;upscale=1&amp;fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&amp;_nc_cb=1&amp;_nc_hash=AQAD8Tds3vkIjeOM&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;262&#34; caption=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;westword.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claim: Denver Police Busting Protesters for Protecting Themselves&lt;/p&gt;Possession of a helmet can allegedly lead to an arrest.&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.westword.com/news/denver-protest-arrests-likened-to-minority-report-11797388&#34;&gt;Possession of a helmet can allegedly lead to an arrest.&lt;/a&gt;</content>

Last night, in a last-minute mobilization, 125 gathered with Antonio Blackbear’s mother, wife, daughter, aunt, and other relative...s to protest his murder by Denver Police two days ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We began with an Indigenous prayer and remarks from family members, including Lynn Eagle Feather, Antonio’s hunka (adopted) aunt, whose son, Paul Castaway, was also murdered by Denver Police five years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With friendly cars following us, we marched a mile from the Capitol Building past the downtown police headquarters and chanted “Cops! Pigs! Murderers!” at the cops guarding the fence they erected around it. We asked them, “Which one of you killed Antonio Blackbear?” and later, when we confronted some sheriff’s deputies, “Which one of you killed Michael Marshall?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the site of Antonio’s murder, family members gathered around a candle-filled memorial and told the crowd about their lost relative. Antonio’s mother expressed how touched she was by the presence of so many who were outraged by the shooting. It was painful to witness yet another family reeling from the shock of the police taking the life of their beloved relative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The march returned to the Capitol and happened to pass a Starbucks along the way, the windows of which proved to be an irresistible temptation. After most of us had dispersed and gone home, two truckloads of riot cops advanced on those that remained. They were clearly coming for a couple of protestors and we were unable to prevent them from doing so. Two were arrested and won’t be able to be bailed out until Monday. Donations for bail can be made to Colorado Freedom Fund: &lt;a href=&#34;https://fundly.com/coloradofreedom&#34;&gt;https://fundly.com/coloradofreedom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thank you to Antonio’s family, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/nativelivesmatter1/&#34;&gt;Native Lives Matter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/AnonResistanceMovement/&#34;&gt;Anon Resistance Movement&lt;/a&gt;, and all who showed up against racist police violence!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “When Indigenous lives are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com&#34;&gt;See More&lt;/a&gt;</content>

And they won&amp;rsquo;t stop until we stop them! On Wednesday, Sept 9, they shot and killed Antonio Blackbear, a 41-year-old Lakota man.&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;Antonio was the adopted cousin of another Lakota man killed by the Denver Police five years ago, Paul Castaway. Indigenous people are more likely than any other racial group to be killed by police. &lt;br /&gt;&#xA;&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;There has been no semblance of justice for Paul in that time, since Denver District Attorneys, like their counterparts around the nation, refuse to hold police accountable for the violent, racist terror that forms the very core of their job description. We expect the fight for justice for Antonio to be a similarly difficult one.&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;The police have yet to release video of their killing of Antonio, nor say much about it, because they are working to craft a story that casts them in the best light.&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;Justice for Antonio Blackbear!&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;Defund, disarm, and disband the police!</content>

Though an appeal to the state Supreme Court is in the works, this means that potentially for most of this winter, the criminal punishment system will deny our unhoused neighb...ors the basic human right to not only safe, affordable housing but to camp undisturbed without having their homes and property &#34;swept&#34; and stolen/trashed under the orders of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/denverdoti/&#34;&gt;Denver Department of Transportation and Infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; or the Denver Department of Public Health and Environment. (Let&#39;s be real, though - we know you&#39;re behind these orders, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/5280mayor/&#34;&gt;Michael B. Hancock&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A recent study by the municipal public defender&#39;s office found that 30% of the people caught in the revolving door of the municipal court system are Black (Denver is 10% Black), and that 38% of total municipal court cases involve unhoused people charged with minor, nonviolent violations directly related to homelessness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Racial justice is intersectional justice - please continue to support organizations like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/coloradodashr/&#34;&gt;Denver Alliance for Street Health Response&lt;/a&gt; who work with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/&#34;&gt;Denver Homeless Out Loud&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that our unhoused neighbors have what they need to survive this winter. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gofundme.com/f/supporting-dashr039s-community-response&#34;&gt;https://www.gofundme.com/f/supporting-dashr039s-community-r…&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/SURJDenver/posts/2692175781056578&#34;&gt;See More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gofundme.com/f/supporting-dashr039s-community-response&#34;&gt;Denver Alliance for Street Health Response (DASHR) is an organization focused o… Vinnie Cervantes needs your support for Supporting DASHR&#39;s Community Response&lt;img src=&#34;https://external.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDTNoUoaYJwrWBv&amp;w=540&amp;h=282&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net%2F48934810_1592509035270542_r.jpeg&amp;cfs=1&amp;upscale=1&amp;fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&amp;_nc_cb=1&amp;_nc_hash=AQAuCSMb-QBmBKDq&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;262&#34; caption=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;gofundme.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporting DASHR&#39;s Community Response, organized by Vinnie Cervantes&lt;/p&gt;Denver Alliance for Street Health Response (DASHR) is an organization focused o… Vinnie Cervantes needs your support for Supporting DASHR&#39;s Community Response&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gofundme.com/f/supporting-dashr039s-community-response&#34;&gt;Denver Alliance for Street Health Response (DASHR) is an organization focused o… Vinnie Cervantes needs your support for Supporting DASHR&#39;s Community Response&lt;/a&gt;</content>

We sold some books, handed out some anti-police pamphlets, and... talked about communism with folks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After a short march to the District 6 police station, protestors shook the temporary fencing around it a little. Denver Police drove us back with lots of pepperballs and teargas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then 30 militia-type fascists with shields, helmets, and batons approached from the opposite direction. We had heard they were coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cops quickly wedged themselves between us, with their backs to the fash, of course. They formed a riot line and forced us back toward the Capitol, firing more pepperballs intermittently. We never saw the fascists again after the cops came to their rescue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com&#34;&gt;See More&lt;/a&gt;</content>

Last Wednesday, when 40+ DPD officers brutalized community members assisting unhoused neighbors with sweeps, we drew a line in the sand. Enough is enough!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We demand justice for our unhoused neighbors, as well as the families of William Debose, Alexis Mendez-Perez, Paul Castaway, Michael Marshall, Marvin Booker, Ryan Ronquillo, Jessie Hernandez and the thousands of people in our city impacted by state-backed violence. The Denver City Council has failed to hear our calls for justice, liberation and abolition. We know that human rights only come alive when citizens organize, protest, boycott, rebel and violate the law in order to uphold justice!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Twelve comrades were arrested last night. Some were released on PR bond but we still have 3 bonds of $500 each to pay and two comrades with bond not allowed until court on Monday afternoon. Please help raise the ransom for these brave rebels and get them out of cages with an active COVID outbreak! Let&#39;s get our comrades back to their loved ones, their pets and their jobs tonight!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As the election approaches, we are looking to make an active bail fund for rebels. Any excess monies will be put into this revolving fund as we work to create it! We will update this post when fundraising goals gave been met!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Solidarity &amp; Power&#34;&lt;br /&gt; ✊🏴🚩🔥&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/denverautonomous/posts/3263594710369967&#34;&gt;See More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/denverautonomous/photos/a.820058771390252/3263581947037910/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/118229396_3263581950371243_8170758790668721699_o.png?_nc_cat=111&amp;_nc_sid=8024bb&amp;_nc_ohc=0HeKuGV7-DEAX9a9-uP&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&amp;oh=ce3a4d4cabeac8db4786f48708d57c7b&amp;oe=5FABF751&#34; alt=&#34;Image may contain: text that says &#39;GIVE EM HELL BAIL FUND SUPPORT DENVER&#39;S ANTI POLICE PROTESTORS ARRESTED AUGUST 22 VENMO: &amp;#064;LOVELIONHIPPOPOTAMUS&#39;&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; caption=&#34;Image may contain: text that says &#39;GIVE EM HELL BAIL FUND SUPPORT DENVER&#39;S ANTI POLICE PROTESTORS ARRESTED AUGUST 22 VENMO: &amp;#064;LOVELIONHIPPOPOTAMUS&#39;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

(Hint: we think it should include abolishing the police.) &lt;br /&gt; We share many others&#39; skepticism about task forces like these, but we know and respect many of the conveners of this forum..., we believe in community engagement even when skepticism is warranted, and as the saying goes, &#34;if you&#39;re not at the table, you&#39;re probably on the menu.&#34; So we hope to see many people attending with a critical eye and an open mind.

NOW WE MUST FIGHT FOR THEM, TOO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &#34;We know this fight is far from over. In many ways, it’s just beginning. DACA was made possible thanks to the organizing efforts of young immigrants, many of them queer, who pushed President Obama to announce it in the summer of 2012...For many of us, including myself, DACA was never the end goal. We knew in 2012 that DACA was supposed to be a stepping stone towards liberation and protection for all our families, especially those who are often deemed not deserving of rights. Our end goal is the safety and liberation of all people, but especially of trans and queer undocumented people.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Jorge Gutierrez, Familia; Trans Queer Liberation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mtv.com/news/3167062/supreme-court-daca-decision-oped/&#34;&gt;The Supreme Court upheld the Obama-era policy, but there is still work to be done to protect the most vulnerable among us&lt;img src=&#34;https://external.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQCDA14HbAH7LmV3&amp;w=540&amp;h=282&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmtv.mtvnimages.com%2Furi%2Fmgid%3Aao%3Aimage%3Amtv.com%3A693512%3Fquality%3D0.8%26format%3Djpg%26width%3D1440%26height%3D810%26.jpg&amp;cfs=1&amp;upscale=1&amp;fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&amp;_nc_cb=1&amp;_nc_hash=AQBmxyeOsMpIDma1&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;262&#34; caption=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;mtv.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DACA Was Made Possible By Young LGBTQ+ Immigrants.

We got DACA in 2012 by escalating from sharing our stories to protesting, hunger strikes, blocking highway...s, occupying campaign offices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is how we wanted to celebrate, and process. This was a statement of solidarity, intersectionality, a reminder that our movement has work to do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everything you saw was 100% envisioned and lead by Unafraid Trans, Queer Undocumented, &amp; DACAmented folx. Organized in just 5 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thankful for friends and allies, I wish I could hug you all. This is community! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Please make a donation to help us with some of our expenses, food and materials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://secure.actblue.com/donate/pjuaf&#34;&gt;https://secure.actblue.com/donate/pjuaf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Padres &amp; Jóvenes Unidos Action Fund&lt;br /&gt; Text UNDOCU303 to 474747 to keep up with us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com&#34;&gt;See More&lt;/a&gt;</content>

This bill ensures some of the strongest police accountability measures in the nation, including an end to qualified immunity. We are grateful to the bill sponsors: Representatives Leslie Herod and Serena Gonzales-Gutierrez and Senators Leroy Garcia and Rhonda Fields,for their leadership and ability to build a bipartisan coalition to pass this bill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Join us tomorrow (Friday, June 1...9th) at 9 AM either on Facebook Live on Representative Herod&#39;s page (&amp;#064;LeslieforColorado) or in person on the West Steps of the Capitol for the bill signing and press conference! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This bill was a response to the protests and long-standing calls for action from the community, and we see its passage as an important step. Until we get to abolition, there must be greater accountability for police &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/accountabilitypendingabolition&#34;&gt;#AccountabilityPendingAbolition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We call on our community to continue the momentum that folks have been working to build for generations to create safe and thriving communities without police and without prisons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/DenverJusticeProject/posts/3137794409608260&#34;&gt;See More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/DenverJusticeProject/photos/a.900402720014118/3137780862942948/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p261x260/104579890_3137780866276281_7225520200228107684_o.jpg?_nc_cat=109&amp;_nc_sid=8024bb&amp;_nc_ohc=7AuA_sb4W-YAX91MMHe&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&amp;tp=6&amp;oh=9ed6968418dceb919ea15f152ae52f2d&amp;oe=5FA95D0C&#34; alt=&#34;Image may contain: 2 people, text that says &#39;JOIN US TOMORROW, JUNE 19 THE LAW ENFORCEMENT INTEGRITY ACT BILL SIGNING &amp; PRESS CONFERENCE END SIGNING: 9AM FACEBOOK LIVE PRESS CONFERENCE: 10AMI WEST STEPS OF THE CAPITOL LESL HEROD&#39;&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;250&#34; caption=&#34;Image may contain: 2 people, text that says &#39;JOIN US TOMORROW, JUNE 19 THE LAW ENFORCEMENT INTEGRITY ACT BILL SIGNING &amp; PRESS CONFERENCE END SIGNING: 9AM FACEBOOK LIVE PRESS CONFERENCE: 10AMI WEST STEPS OF THE CAPITOL LESL HEROD&#39;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

Así se habla! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Firme la petición para exigir que Univisión y Telemundo deja de alimentar la anti-Ne...gritud: &lt;a href=&#34;https://bit.ly/lasvidasnegrasimportan&#34;&gt;bit.ly/lasvidasnegrasimportan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &#34;Entiendo que va haber mucho dolor en este momento para nuestra comunidad pero también tenemos una responsabilidad de hacer conección de todo lo que está pasando. Por que la comunidad Negra está marchando y protestando en estos momentos? Porque la policía sigue matando a la gente Negra. Porque la patrulla fronteriza está matando a nuestra gente en la frontera entonces mi llamado ahorita en nuestra comunidad es pensar más allá de nosotros, hacer todas las conecciones, tomar las calles, organizarnos para que toda esta violencia puede terminar. Y ustedes como Univisión tienen responsabilidad de contar toda la historia de todo lo que esta pasando así como hablamos de las deportaciones ustedes también tienen que hablar por que la gente sigue muriendo en manos de la policía, particularmente la gente Negra. Ese es mi llamado. En este momento hacer negocio con esta administración es una traición a la comunidad Negra y a las familias que siguen muriendo.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ******&lt;br /&gt; Sign the petition to demand Univisión and Telemundo stop their antiBlack coverage:  &lt;a href=&#34;https://bit.ly/lasvidasnegrasimportan&#34;&gt;bit.ly/lasvidasnegrasimportan&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &#34;I understand that there is going to be a lot of pain right now for our community but we also have a responsibility to make connections between everything that is happening. Why is the Black community marching and protesting right now? Because the police are still killing Black people. Because border patrol is killing our people. So my call to action right now in our community is to think beyond us, make these connections, take to the streets, and organize so that all this violence can end. And you as Univision have a responsibility to tell the whole story of everything that is happening, just like how we talk about deportations, you also have to talk about why people keep dying at the hands of the police, particularly Black people. That is my call to action. Right now doing business with this administration is a betrayal of the Black community and the families that continue to die. &#34;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com&#34;&gt;See More&lt;/a&gt;</content>

We see this new community-driven service as a form of preventative medicine for police violence. If it had been in place long ...ago, could have prevented the deaths of Elijah McClain, Michael Marshall, Paul Castaway, Paul Childs, and countless other victims of police violence in Denver. &lt;br /&gt; Abolition is not a metaphor - it&#39;s a tangible possibility, and this is an important example of how our communities can start to build the alternatives to modern policing that we need to keep our communities safe. We can have a world without police. We can have a world without prisons. And we are already on our way to building it.&lt;br /&gt; Read more about the STAR program in our joint press release with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/&#34;&gt;Denver Homeless Out Loud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/coloradodashr/&#34;&gt;Denver Alliance for Street Health Response&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/harmreductionactioncenter/&#34;&gt;Harm Reduction Action Center&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/RecoveringDenver/&#34;&gt;Mental Health Center of Denver&lt;/a&gt;here: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.denverjusticeproject.org/2020/06/08/press-release-alternative-public-health-emergency-response-pilot-launches-in-denver&#34;&gt;www.denverjusticeproject.org/…/press-release-alternative-pu…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/DenverJusticeProject/posts/3110110802376621&#34;&gt;See More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/DenverJusticeProject/photos/a.900402720014118/3110107502376951/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/103066453_3110107505710284_8653334129786094722_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&amp;_nc_sid=8024bb&amp;_nc_ohc=c2syWQIEnlYAX8uC6QV&amp;_nc_oc=AQn6n-7yY8r96sKcqsuMyBVMlulGM7xt7luLxMuZEKbaXZSjewRVlU_OhWDLk5vZkUc&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&amp;oh=5031f8408cd8670daa31c5549bf6c7b0&amp;oe=5FA8E4BA&#34; alt=&#34;Image may contain: text that says &#39;YOU ARE EXPERIENCING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS &amp; AFRAID IMAGINE...

We encourage friends to donate to BLM5280’s Emergency Fund using Venmo &lt;a href=&#34;http://venmo.com/BLM5280&#34;&gt;http://venmo.com/BLM5280&lt;/a&gt; . These donations will be used for bail, legal support, and provision of direct services for Black people impacted by the current and ongoing crisis. If you would like to make a tax-deductible donation that we will have access to at a later date, you can visit our Colorado Gives Day Page to donate through our fiscal sponsor, Rocky Mountain Peace and Justice Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coloradogives.org/blacklivesmatter5280?fbclid=IwAR1t7dAAIhYEJInABjnkuQQ8zXNM4-96UZ7TKuKD46kesJyTcY60b7eK1Qk&#34;&gt;Working with residents and organizations in Denver, Black Lives Matter 5280 assists in building more loving and united Black communities while eliminating anti-Black violence and racism.
