Run by private prison company GEO Group through a contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the detention center holds a wide range of immigrant detainees, including asylum seekers, undocumented immigrants with and without criminal convictions, and documented immigrants who are potentially subject to deportation because of cri...minal convictions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e The movie, titled \"The Facility,\" highlights the pain experienced by families who lose a loved one to immigrant detention, which often leads to deportation. \"I was just really overwhelmed by the stories I was hearing,\" says Flood, who lived in the encampment with families whose husbands, fathers and sons were detained across the street at the detention facility.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Flood hopes that the film will help push policymakers toward abolishing for-profit immigrant detention, something that activists in Colorado have been demanding for years. \"I see the reflection of my own history in a lot of what’s going on in our immigration system and the way that it’s sort of set up not to serve the public interest or public safety, but to make an extraordinary profit,\" says Flood, who is Black.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Flood's favorite character in the film is Raul Medina Perez, a 29-year-old who has called the United States home since he came here at the age of five. ICE detained Medina Perez in 2019, and the film shows his eventual release after eleven months in ICE detention and the reunification with his family outside the detention center.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e \"I feel like I really connected with Raul because we’re about the same age,\" says Flood. \"He was so relatable.

Bergen C...ounty Correctional Facility has a new contract with ICE to detain undocumented people in inhumane conditions. In response to this some of the detainees have thrown a hunger strike to demand their immediate release- this hunger strike has lasted over 30 days and nothing has changed regarding the conditions or their release. There is no such thing as “illegal aliens” don’t let the language fool you into demonizing the true natives of this land. Don’t let political terms such as “annexed” or “treaty” fool you into believing that stripping people from their families is legal.
