And I\u0026#39;m all for demoralizing the shit out of them. But as someone with mental health challenges, it\u0026#39;s VERY triggering to me when people yell at cops to kill themselves. Am I the only one? I feel like a lot of my fellow comrades struggle with their mental health as well, and that\u0026#39;s only going to get worse as the battle continues. In the same vein as yelling homophobic and transphobic slurs at the police hurts our LGBTQ comrades, yelling at cops to kill themselves can be very ableist and hurtful to neurodivergent folks.

We have asked the City to fulfill their responsibility and place portable toilets,  handwashing stations, and trash cans at every encampment and they have continued to refuse. So we as a small commu...nity organization have had to front the bill for the few we could afford. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Thanks to a $25k grant from the Colorado Health Foundation for emergency COVID needs, we were able pay for 5 portable toilets, supplies for handwashing stations (in collaboration with Mutual Aid Denver (MAD), trash cans and bags for each toilet, sharps boxes, and compensation for people living on those blocks to clean the toilet units every day. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e But we have now run out of those funds. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e In order to keep providing the sanitation resources at encampments, we need some serious funding for this project ASAP!! \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e As long as the City continues to refuse to do their job, someone has to step up to do it for them. We need your help to make this possible. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e In order to continue to run these port-a-potties and sanitation resources for the remainder of 2020 we need at least $25k. If we do not get at least 5k by September we will not be able to continue these resources. It costs us just over $800 a month for each regular portable toilet, and $1000 for an ADA toilet, plus moving charges after police sweeps, plus the pay for someone from the encampment to do an extra cleaning of it each day, plus cleaning supplies and supplies to build and maintain the handwashing stations. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Furthermore, in order to keep these resources available on the streets in 2021, we need at least $100k. This would enable us to maintain these resources in 2021, and if there were more funding we could expand these resources to more encampments and with more needed services. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e These are basic human needs. The CDC guidance tells cities to provide these sanitation resources to every encampment of 10 people or more. Denver has not provided these for any encampment. As we continue to fight for the City to step up and do their job, we also ask the community for support in meeting this need.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Please contact us with any questions, donations, or ongoing funding. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Contact us at: \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e info\u0026#064;denverhomelessoutloud.org\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e 720-940-5291\u003c/p\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/1978290188967591\"\u003eSee More\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/photos/a.271630356300258/1978289972300946/\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/118518262_1978289975634279_4489310859575748709_o.jpg?_nc_cat=101\u0026_nc_sid=8024bb\u0026_nc_ohc=uLlsKUNphJMAX8qr8NE\u0026_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna\u0026tp=6\u0026oh=5af9f9b38f63c9a58fe431c8d01f4ebf\u0026oe=5F7558F4\" alt=\"Image may contain: people standing and outdoor\" width=\"500\" height=\"667\" caption=\"Image may contain: people standing and outdoor\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e",

Many of the residents of the encampment at 25th and Arapahoe have been living there for over 5 month. They have never got a bad mark when health inspectors have come by. The camp is clean and well managed. We in DHOL pay for a port-a-potty at the camp and together with MAD maintain the handwashing station. Most residents are on housing waitlists or otherwise actively seeking housing - to no avail. Yet, regardless the City is planning to sweep this group of about 50 people to nowhere on Tuesday. Some of the newer residents of this camp are here after moving from the sweeps at 22nd last week. They will be moved again with no solution as to where to go. If you want to come support the residents of this camp please do. The voice of residents who are facing this trauma need to be heard.

It didn\u0026#39;t take long for both sides to get in a shouting match with DPD in riot gear coming in seperating both sides. As this was happening in plain view of MULTIPLE officers and witnesses I was punched in the face by a Proud boy. Not a big surprise. What was surprising was the 5 officers who then tackled me to the ground while allowing my assailant to flee along with the rest of the PBs. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI tried to get the officers to speak to with witnesses or look at the video which shows I never even raised my hands. The SGT. on duty laughed that off and I was charged with public fighting and not allowed to press charges. I spent the night in jail on what was described as outstanding warrants. That turned out to be false and the report of the night was suspiciously bare. I\u0026#39;m currently seeking body cam footage and will update/post as soon as I can. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI was told by the Sgt that \u0026quot;it was good that I was being arrested, I had no reason to be out there\u0026quot; I\u0026#39;m sharing this because I want everyone to understand that as a brown man I do not regret a single moment of what occured, I will not be bullied by badges, titles, or militias.

His age and respiratory ailments put him at risk of serious illness and death if he contracts COVID-19. With over hundreds of active cases in Colorado’s prisons, his family fears he will not make it out alive. His daughter, Amber, says, “In prison, he can’t protect himself and he can’t social distance. My deep fear is that my dad will die in prison. That is an awful, traumatic reality to consider. My chest is tight just thinking about how quickly it spreads and how vulnerable he is.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Ronald has served 22 years in prison for theft, forgery, fraud and drug possession, and he takes full responsibility for his actions. Amber has seen how her father has changed. She recalls when she was 18, headed to college and heard her father was sentenced to 96 years in prison. She says, “I did not have a lot of respect for him when he was first sentenced. I told him I was so disappointed that his careless actions were going to cause so much suffering for his family. Since I said that, he made a change. He has been sober 15 years and I have witnessed the transformation. Now, I have a dad. I have someone I respect and love. He is a model in the prison, and he will better our community when he is free.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Ronald has spent decades devoting himself to self-improvement and supporting other incarcerated people. He is an Offender Care Aide who assists incarcerated people with medical disabilities, mentors incarcerated people earning their GED and coordinates the mental health course offered to incarcerated people. He has completed numerous job trainings, courses and programs including Bridges to Life and Thinking for a Change. Ronald has spent over ten years in an incentive unit, which requires him to avoid disciplinary infractions, where he assists staff with maintenance of the facility. He says, “Ten years ago, I never would have believed I would be working with, and alongside, correctional staff. Just as times change, so do people and so have I.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Governor Hickenlooper shortened his sentence following testimony from family, friends and correctional officers advocating for his early release. Yet, he is still eight years away from parole. While he remains in prison, COVID-19 continues to spread. Ronald’s three siblings, four children and four grandchildren are desperate for his release. Amber says, “When people say “Black Lives Matter”, they mean that our lives are not dispensable. My dad was sentenced to 96 years in prison for a nonviolent offense fueled by addiction and desperation. His incarceration has caused four generations – from his parents who died before seeing their son free to my children growing up without a grandpa – unspeakable pain and trauma. We have lost so much time with him. We just need him safely home.”   \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/decarcerationday\"\u003e#decarcerationday\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/freethemall\"\u003e#FreeThemAll\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/covidjustice\"\u003e#covidjustice\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/carenotcages\"\u003e#carenotcages\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/endmassincarceration\"\u003e#endmassincarceration\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/covidcolorado\"\u003e#COVIDcolorado\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/doyourpart\"\u003e#doyourpart\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/bringourneighborshome\"\u003e#bringourneighborshome\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/redemptionisreal\"\u003e#redemptionisreal\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/clemencyiscompassion\"\u003e#clemencyiscompassion\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com\"\u003eSee More\u003c/a\u003e",

This is why PSL Denver is backing tomorrow’s Decarceration Day of Action. Join the rally at noon tomorrow at the capitol and read Dr. Apryl Alexander’s opinion piece on the day of a...ction in the Denver Post.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e “After briefly allowing increased prisoner releases, the governor has rescinded that authority and refuses to exercise any of his broad powers to safely reduce the prison population.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Surely, the governor is aware that the United States incarcerates people at a higher rate than any other country in the world, and that mass incarceration has destroyed Black communities, without improving public safety. Surely he is aware that our carceral system is founded on racist principles, and the racial make-up of our prisons is a reflection of historical and ongoing systemic racism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Yet, rather than acknowledging the humanity of people living behind bars and the racism underlying the prison system, Gov. Polis has contributed to a public narrative that demonizes incarcerated people as unredeemable and too dangerous to be free. When advocates called for thoughtful releases of vulnerable incarcerated people, Gov. Polis’ response: He would not “let dangerous criminals out.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Come on, governor. No one wants you to release “dangerous criminals.” We all want to be safe. That’s why advocates have been calling for the release of people who are elderly, sick, or have otherwise proven they are not a public safety threat. Decades of mass incarceration has ensured that there are many such people in Colorado’s prisons, and racism has ensured that those people will be disproportionately Black.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Here’s just one example: Ron Johnson is a 62-year-old Black grandfather who has turned his life around in prison. He suffers from asthma, high blood pressure, and uses an inhaler to breathe, so he is at high risk for COVID. He is no threat to the public. He lives in an incentive unit where he cares for other incarcerated people with medical disabilities and mentors incarcerated people earning their GED.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1013272209125269\"\u003eSee More\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2020/08/21/colorado-prison-inmates-covid-polis-opinion/\"\u003eBlack people living behind bars face a racist double whammy – because of their blackness they are more likely to be imprisoned, more likely to get COVID, and more likely to die from the virus.\u003cimg src=\"https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDU2ss0M9u-Cnys\u0026w=540\u0026h=282\u0026url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.denverpost.com%2Fwp-content%2Fthemes%2Fdenverpost%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fdenverpost.jpg\u0026cfs=1\u0026upscale=1\u0026fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher\u0026_nc_cb=1\u0026_nc_hash=AQAY47PODuk1InCF\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"262\" caption=\"\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003edenverpost.com\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGuest commentary: If Black lives matter to him, Polis needs to reduce prison population\u003c/p\u003eBlack people living behind bars face a racist double whammy – because of their blackness they are more likely to be imprisoned, more likely to get COVID, and more likely to die from the virus.\u003ca href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2020/08/21/colorado-prison-inmates-covid-polis-opinion/\"\u003eBlack people living behind bars face a racist double whammy – because of their blackness they are more likely to be imprisoned, more likely to get COVID, and more likely to die from the virus.\u003c/a\u003e",

I’m not talking about it’s close cousin white guilt. Penitenti...al whiteness differs from white guilt in that it is vocal. It’s more than a feeling...it falls over itself to outperform and out woke every other white “ally.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Penitential whiteness might look and sound desirable, but I can guarantee you that it absolutely is not. It is exhausting. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Penitential whiteness is a paradox. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e It demands labor by performing labor. Instead of lending quiet support behind the scenes, it is loud and in front. It needs the cookies and badges from Black people. If no cookies are given, there is an assumption that something went wrong, and so the penitential white person become insecure and needs to make sure they’re still a “good person.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e It centers itself by de-centering whiteness. Penitential whiteness makes sure that everyone knows that they are not in the center by telling everyone that they aren’t in the center. They are in the center of all of the fe-centering. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Penitential whiteness does everything at full steam. If it’s calling out other white folks penitent white folks will be the loudest and most persistent. If it is if it’s raising awareness, you can expect a full, scripted pitch. If it is showing up, it will be the first one there and the last to leave. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Penitential whiteness, on the surface, might seem like a healthy expression of allyship (or whatever y’all calling it right now). The difference between being a healthy co-conspirator and a penitential white individual is about posture. Penitential white folks can do good work, but that good work is rooted in relieving the pressure to prove their goodness rather than in the liberation of others. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Beware and be wary of penitential whiteness. It’s not a good look. At the end of the day, penitential whiteness does more harm than good because the “work” of a penitential person of whiteness is rooted in their zeal to prove themselves. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Penitential whiteness does not combat white supremacy, it reinforces it by—once again—making people of whiteness the hero of their own narratives. The narrative, in this case, is being The Best Ally That Ever Allied and sucking all of the air (and liberation) out of the room. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e I don’t expect everyone to understand or agree with this word. But I hope that it will at least get folks thinking about how they approach the work of antiracism.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com\"\u003eSee More\u003c/a\u003e",

The program provides a more appropriate and more humane approach to crisis involving homelessness, mental health, and substance use. The CAHOOTS program answers about one-fifth of the 911 calls in Eugene and saves the city on average $8 million per year. DASHR’s efforts, alongside other community groups and partners, resulted in the launch of the new STAR (Support Team Assisted Response) pilot program in Denver on June 1st. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Since January, DASHR has also been working with members of Aurora’s City Council to explore building a model similar to CAHOOTS. “Aurora currently has a co-responder model, but we know that a police presence can escalate a situation,“ said Councilwoman Allison Hiltz who chairs the public safety committee on council. “In looking at other models, we are better able to prioritize our community’s needs and rethink how we deliver mental health care.” She plans to present a brief update on their progress at a committee meeting on August 27, with hopes for a more complete proposal in the near future. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Natalia Marshall, whose uncle Michael Marshall was killed in the Denver jail noted that this type of response could prevent similar things from happening. “My uncle Michael had schizophrenia and when he called police to report his bible as stolen, he was met by police officers instead of mental health professionals who brought him to the jail, which led to his death.” She adds that he needed mental health services not jail. Natalia is an Aurora resident and activist for alternatives to police and criminal justice reform.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e DASHR strongly believes in creating alternatives to policing, jail, and the prison industrial complex more generally. “I believe we’re in a critical moment where the ideas we’ve been fighting to achieve for years are finally getting the attention and consideration they’ve always deserved,” said Vinnie Cervantes, Organizing Director of DASHR. “It’s important that our solutions are truly alternatives to systemic harm and that they are led by the community” DASHR is committed to helping facilitate community involvement in the programs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e About DASHR\u003cbr /\u003e Denver Alliance for Street Health Response (DASHR) is a coalition of groups and individuals who create and support community- based responses to crisis and conflict, as well as forge new narratives of public health and safety.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com\"\u003eSee More\u003c/a\u003e",

On July 12, 2019, radicals and impacted families split from the milquetoast Lights for Liberty vigil being conducted at the Aurora ICE Processing Center. Rebels marched  into the parking lot of GEO- where anticolonial speeches were given by indigenous youth and where the now infamous flag removal occurred. \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nFollowing the flag removal and international embarrassment, the Aurora Police Department began a Twitter manhunt offering a $4k reward to identify suspects from that evening; violent crimes typically only get a $1k reward and we knew this outrageously large reward was made because two anti police flags were flown that night. Cowards at APD wouldn't fire or prosecute the murderers of Elijah McClain the following month, yet APD had the time and resources to target non-violent protestors demanding justice for immigrants.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe woman featured in this powerful photo, Michelle, was eventually identified by non profit \u0026quot;allies\u0026quot; and served misdemeanor tampering charges; Michelle's case with Aurora dragged on for over a year. Today we have some good news: our hero was found NOT GUILTY by jury trial and walks free of all charges! Fuck APD!\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nMichelle- you are an inspiration and a true Chingona. With you, our city sent a message to the Department of Homeland Security.  Your bravery, in addition to the life Willem Van Spronsen gave on July 13th 2019 by setting ICE's kidnapping vans in Tacoma ablaze, made ICE retreat on their planned nationwide mass arrests of immigrants.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n#ChingaLaMigra #AbolishICE\u003cbr /\u003e\nPhoto by @buffalo_heart_images",

Black August, first commemorated by our incarcerated brothers and sisters, is a time to recommit ourselves to the struggle for #BlackLiberation and to honor those who\u0026rsquo;ve contributed to our collective progress and all those who have been lost to unjust violence and systemic racism.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThis August 21, join us in a car protest to bring the Black August fight to our local prison walls. We will drive in a mobile protest to the Denver County Jail and the GEO Aurora ICE detention facility to let those who are chained there know that we are with them, we are fighting for them, and we will keep fighting until all chains are broken.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe many injustices faced by those behind bars in the U.S. are today amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Prisons and jails all across the country, where medical neglect is commonplace and quarantining impossible, have become hotspots of infection. Hundreds have died in US prisons from COVID-19, and yet no response has been made to defend against unnecessary death. The mass incarceration of Black, Brown, and Indigenous populations means that they are not only disproportionately affected by the virus outside of jail, but inside as well.\u003cbr /\u003e\nWe raise the following demands, recognizing that if they are not met, more unnecessary death is a certainty:\u003cbr /\u003e\n1. Immediate humanitarian release of all ICE detainees and all vulnerable inmates, those convicted for non-violent offenses, and those who have not been convicted at all.\u003cbr /\u003e\n2. Where people remain behind bars, drastically increase medical staffing and supplies to local jails and state prisons, and guarantee sanitary conditions for all inmates.\u003cbr /\u003e\n3. Free all political prisoners!\u003cbr /\u003e\n#FreeThemAll #DecarcerateNOW #decarcerateCOVID19",

You might recognize Kesha and Leah from their incredible work at the \u0026#064;abolishicedenver encampment that took place in front of the GEO detention center in Aurora this summer. Kesha and Leah spent 79 days camped there advocating for Pablo’s freedom and the freedom of all people detained inside. Kesha’s work—leading nightly vigils, talking with media, selling t-shirts, helped raise thousands of dollars not just... for her husband’s legal costs but also those of other impacted families. Her advocacy also led to the universal COVID testing provided at the facility (at that time, one of only two in the country to test everyone inside). On July 11 her husband was transferred to Teller county in retaliation for their activism, but Kesha stayed at GEO advocating for the liberation of all detainees. Support her this weekend by buying tacos. \u003ca href=\"https://tinyurl.com/solidaritymealsaugust22\"\u003etinyurl.com/solidaritymealsaugust22\u003c/a\u003e \u0026#064; Denver, Colorado\u003c/p\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Sanctuary4AllCO/posts/2704426173179632\"\u003eSee More\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Sanctuary4AllCO/photos/pcb.2704426173179632/2704426053179644/\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s261x260/117803864_2704426059846310_3082127598261029416_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101\u0026_nc_sid=9e2e56\u0026_nc_ohc=0EBwoMmvG7EAX9vo0g1\u0026_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna\u0026tp=7\u0026oh=e2c52ff39c53f4b0f3ab1179483994f4\u0026oe=5F7460ED\" alt=\"Image may contain: 3 people, people standing, closeup and indoor\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" caption=\"Image may contain: 3 people, people standing, closeup and indoor\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Sanctuary4AllCO/photos/pcb.2704426173179632/2704426126512970/\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s261x260/117845101_2704426133179636_9170883169215797025_o.jpg?_nc_cat=110\u0026_nc_sid=9e2e56\u0026_nc_ohc=u5J_YoWdHdwAX-7pg7_\u0026_nc_oc=AQlZC1uTBYwsdHeiSziiKgy8c14AFnpI5QyJwy61E5nq3oJGXHPY9f-iw9aqAck_pM0\u0026_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna\u0026tp=7\u0026oh=4d19956a760c13de57f84aa71ec06bb7\u0026oe=5F71DD6B\" alt=\"Image may contain: text that says 'tacos TACOS VECETARIANOS $2 POTATO\u0026 MUSHROOM TACOS SERVED WITH CILANTRO, RED ONION, SALSA VERDE \u0026 SALSA ROJA TACOS DE BARBACOA $2 BARBACOA TACOS SERVED WITH CILANTRO, RED ONION, SALSA VERDE \u0026 SALSA ROJA ONE POUND OF TACOS DE BARBACOA $12 A POUND OF READY-TO-ASSEMBLE BARBACOA WITH TORTILLAS, CILANTRO, ONION, SALSA ROJA \u0026 SALSA VERDE PROVIDED TINYURL.COM/SOLIDARITYMEALSAUGUST2 \u0026#064;KESHA-DAVALOS'\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" caption=\"Image may contain: text that says 'tacos TACOS VECETARIANOS $2 POTATO\u0026 MUSHROOM TACOS SERVED WITH CILANTRO, RED ONION, SALSA VERDE \u0026 SALSA ROJA TACOS DE BARBACOA $2 BARBACOA TACOS SERVED WITH CILANTRO, RED ONION, SALSA VERDE \u0026 SALSA ROJA ONE POUND OF TACOS DE BARBACOA $12 A POUND OF READY-TO-ASSEMBLE BARBACOA WITH TORTILLAS, CILANTRO, ONION, SALSA ROJA \u0026 SALSA VERDE PROVIDED TINYURL.COM/SOLIDARITYMEALSAUGUST2 \u0026#064;KESHA-DAVALOS'\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e",

We'll be discussing how Proposition 115 ignores the unique circumstances in a woman's pregnancy. Instead, it bans abortion even in cases where the woman's health is at risk, or after a fatal fetal diagnosis — causing lasting harm for women and families in Colorado.

It was challenging both because of Covid-19 and our client’s innocence (which he walked in and away with). I’m here to say that in 2021 I will work on legislation in Colorado that will strip these “oh so powerful” prosecutors of their full immunity, force them to pay defense costs upon acquittal, and institute a law that requires DA’s offices to disclose when their deputies have been found to commit misconduct, or hidden or destroyed discovery.  If any of these these three laws were enacted, our client - and many others - would never be charged with baseless and  speculative crimes.\u003c/p\u003e",

When will the City ever learn that homeless whack-a-mole does not work!??

Then they back tracked on that…They lied to the community. But there was a standing agreement from the City under the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure (DOTI) that, “Due to the COVID-19 crisis, once the area is cleaned, people experiencing homelessness may return to the cleaned area, if they choose to do so.”  We are demanding they at least follow this agreement! \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Even better the City should actually start following the CDC guidance - not sweeping encampments and rather providing necessary sanitation resources. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Displacing everyone even for a day instead of providing sanitation resources, support resources, and ultimately housing is not the answer...But scattering everyone to who knows where is fundamentally not a solution. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e We cannot keep pretending homelessness will disappear with sweeps. If we even want homelessness to disappear we have to start fighting for attainable housing for ALL and not fighting the visibility of homelessness. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Be there Monday morning at 12th and Acoma.

And you as Univision have a responsibility to tell the whole story of everything that is happening, just like how we talk about deportations, you also have to talk about why people keep dying at the hands of the police, particularly Black people.

We see this new community-driven service as a form of preventative medicine for police violence.
