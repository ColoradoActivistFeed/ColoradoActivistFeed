Hampton was just 21 years old, but his life was rich in struggle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Hampton was a community-builder. He brokered a nonaggression pact between Chicago’s most powerful street gangs, urging them to turn their anger and guns around on their oppressors, not on one another. He created the Rainbow Coalition, a class-conscious and multi-racial alliance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e On December 4th 1969, the Chica...go PD drugged Chairman Fred, stormed his apartment and executed him in his sleep, along with Panther leader Mark Clark. Fred’s wife and son somehow survived the volley of 99 bullets. It was a military style invasion and execution.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e This was not an isolated instance. This was US government policy.\u003cbr /\u003e Hampton’s murder was part of a pattern of police raids, false imprisonment and executions of Black Panthers. COINTELPRO documents proved that assassination of Black leaders was among its aims. Fred Hampton and the Black Panther Party had to be eliminated simply because they had touched upon capitalism’s greatest weakness—the decisiveness and strength that a multi-national movement has in a battle against this system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e The Black Panther Party arose from the struggles of the African American people, historically the most oppressed and exploited group in the United States. They symbolized hope and received the greatest affection. They attributed Black oppression to the capitalist system, and dared to pick up arms against the state. The militancy and defiance of these young revolutionaries deeply impacted the Civil Rights and socialist movements.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Hampton and the Black Panthers believed all would benefit if the banner of the struggle against racism and national oppression was taken up by the white masses as their own. Hampton knew that it was possible to smash the racial barriers created by capitalism to divide and conquer the working class. His confidence was based on the strong belief that this system provides a motive for all to unite and engage in revolutionary struggle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Long live the memory of Fred Hampton and the Black Panther Party!\u003c/p\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1098584813927341\"\u003eSee More\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1098584813927341/1098583950594094/\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/130157059_1098583953927427_6814982066463741412_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110\u0026ccb=2\u0026_nc_sid=8024bb\u0026_nc_ohc=ADOjcrNAyCIAX8aCsoI\u0026_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna\u0026tp=6\u0026oh=e197e7c45cc3a11f5a3514b946bfbff0\u0026oe=5FF3B484\" alt=\"Image may contain: 1 person, text that says 'FRED HAMPTON 1948-1969 \"If you dare to struggle, you dare to win.

Fidel fought without let-up for his people, for revolution, for socialism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Fidel was the ultimat...e revolutionary. He was fully aware of his essential historic leadership in the Revolution, but just as important was his guidance in building the Communist Party of Cuba and continually inspiring a people who would fight no matter the adversities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e The revolution against the U.S. puppet Batista, which ushered in the Cuban Revolution, was carried out during what would seem an inauspicious time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e The 1950s were a time of anti-communist hysteria led by the United States which thoroughly dominated Cuba at the time and whose aim was to crush the communist movement and workers’ struggles at home and abroad. Yet, Fidel believed that after Batista’s military coup in 1952, that it was the very time to strike.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e The next year, Fidel led the July 26 assault on the Moncada barracks in eastern Cuba. While the revolutionary combatants were defeated and many killed, the Moncada attack would give birth to the July 26th Movement. In 1956, Fidel and his comrades, including Che Guevara and Raul Castro, launched the guerrilla war that brought down the Batista regime on January 1, 1959.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e The 1950s and 60s was also a time of emerging national liberation struggles in Africa, Latin America and Asia\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Fidel’s steel determination and victory over U.S. imperialism helped revive the ideas of revolutionary socialism in Latin America and across the globe. Many national liberation struggles in Latin America, Africa and Asia gained strength from the assistance of revolutionary Cuba.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Fidel’s legacy will endure because he leaves a strong country of true revolutionaries, people who have given of themselves countless times as medical workers, as teachers, as construction workers, as military combatants, all for the liberation of humanity.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1092105257908630\"\u003eSee More\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/a.378847259234437/1092104954575327/\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/128054634_1092104957908660_1528222301583953425_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110\u0026ccb=2\u0026_nc_sid=110474\u0026_nc_ohc=9wN94vm8WOYAX_R0c6L\u0026_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna\u0026tp=6\u0026oh=c0d3997942211cfda901a88a74808be0\u0026oe=5FF08072\" alt=\"Image may contain: 1 person, text that says 'VIVA FIDEL!
