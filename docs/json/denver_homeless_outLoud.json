They can also set up long term leases at hotels as they move forward in buying vacant hotels. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Homelessness ends with a home. This is possible. The time is now.

Five portable toilets serviced 5 days a week, moving charges after police sweeps, pay for a resident of the encampment to do an extra cleaning of the portable toilet each day, cleaning supplies, and some of the supplies to maintain the handwashing stations (done together with Mutual Aid Denver). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Again, we must note, this should be the city’s responsibility. The city currently has a contract with Liberty Waste that could pay for portable toilets and handwashing stations at every encampment around town.

We will continue to make this demand heard…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e In the meanwhile… your donations to pay for toilets and handwashing ensures at least 5 encampments, totaling at least 350 people, have access to a toilet and soap and water to wash their hands.

They called the sweep it off last min due to the weather event last week and some prodding of the folks working on setting the first SOS camp up.  Think about it, the 1st welcoming sanctioned place was going to get swept to make it a “welcoming”place for the homeless.   Perhaps the people who are already there are not the “right kind” of homeless people.  Which, if you think about, it begins to sound racist.  Homelessness always have a heavy dose of racism mixed in.  \u003ca href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2020/09/12/mayor-hancock-homeless-campsite/\"\u003ehttps://www.denverpost.com/…/mayor-hancock-homeless-campsi…/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/1992189524244324\"\u003eSee More\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2020/09/12/mayor-hancock-homeless-campsite/\"\u003eMayor Michael Hancock said a small strip of city-owned property between Sonny Lawson Park and the Blair-Caldwell Library could a possible place for individuals to set up campsites in a controlled e…\u003cimg src=\"https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDFkAfpHLLIT2xM\u0026w=540\u0026h=282\u0026url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.denverpost.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F06%2FTDP-L-MAYOR-HANCOCK-PRESSER-PROTESTERS_JAC1203x.jpg%3Fw%3D1024%26h%3D772\u0026cfs=1\u0026upscale=1\u0026fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher\u0026_nc_cb=1\u0026_nc_hash=AQC2PTpq_7GQK_af\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"262\" caption=\"\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003edenverpost.com\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDenver identifies possible designated campsite for those experiencing homelessness\u003c/p\u003eMayor Michael Hancock said a small strip of city-owned property between Sonny Lawson Park and the Blair-Caldwell Library could a possible place for individuals to set up campsites in a controlled e…\u003ca href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2020/09/12/mayor-hancock-homeless-campsite/\"\u003eMayor Michael Hancock said a small strip of city-owned property between Sonny Lawson Park and the Blair-Caldwell Library could a possible place for individuals to set up campsites in a controlled e…\u003c/a\u003e",

Some of these people moved back the night after the swe...ep, others a few days after, but in any case folks have been living on these blocks since the sweep with no indication that the area is “closed.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e At least 6 people will show up today to find all their property gone. One of these people, Van, showed up shortly after the police had just trashed, not stored, his tent and all his property. This is the same man who stood his ground against the police on one leg at the sweep two weeks ago. All of the residents of this area are scattered to nowhere...\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e After coming in and taking these people’s property around 12noon, one resident - David - showed up on site as the city was about to grab his property. The police agreed to give him two hours to pack and move. Just after 2pm police showed up, walked up and arrested Daivd at 2:14pm for “disobeying a lawful order” aka being 6 minutes late to move his property as he was actively in the midst of moving his property. Police did not give him any warning or any time when they walked up on him at 2:14pm to arrest him. They just threw him in handcuffs and told him he was under arrest. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e A few minutes later, another man - Allen - who had just had his property taken from the city two hours earlier and walked up to it being gone, came back to the area since we had found someone to give him a ride to try to get his stuff from storage and he was immediately arrested. Police claimed he was on body camera footage threatening an officer and arrested him for “threats to an officer.” This same officer who he supposedly threatened, was caught on camera pushing his car door into Allen and grabbing his arm and pushing him back. This was all as Allen was trying to ask officers for business cards after his property had just been taken. Two hours later police proceeded to arrest him with great force and had him on the ground for over 30 minutes. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e You don’t have to look any farther to see the intersection of racism, homelessness, and police brutality. Police arrested these men for NOTHING because that is what police do to homeless black people. Enough is enough.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Thanks to community members who are bailing these men out of jail. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Watch livestream and others on our facebook of these sweeps and arrests \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/videos/716517545872124/\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/videos/716517545872124\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/1988439837952626\"\u003eSee More\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/\"\u003eDenver Homeless Out Loud\u003c/a\u003e was live.\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/videos/716517545872124/\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e",
