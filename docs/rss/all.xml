      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If mods think this is off-topic, please delete and suggest a different sub. Maybe this is just <a href="/r/offmychest">r/offmychest</a> material.</p> <p>First some background.</p> <p>My mother is an elementary school teacher, in her 60&#39;s with multiple underlying conditions. She&#39;s very liberal and usually incredibly nice and helpful. I had to move back in with her due to CoViD and how that made my financial situation untenable. She&#39;s been doing online schooling since April. Now, they&#39;re doing a slow roll on reopening the school, 1 or 2 grades at a time. They&#39;ve implemented a lot of security theater, but done very little to actually prevent spread.</p> <p>There are now confirmed CoViD cases in the school and all they&#39;ve done is send emails to parents saying everything is fine. Then they quarantined that class, even though the kids from all classes play together at recess. It has likely already spread.</p> <p>Now my mom&#39;s grade goes back next week, and I don&#39;t want her to die. Or have long lasting after effects. Or have my sister get it. Or me.</p> <p>For months, me and my little sister have been trying to get her to organize with her fellow teachers in order to better protect themselves from the bureaucratic bull that their admin imposes on them. She sees and agrees that she will likely get it from one of her kids, but refuses to even hear us out; to organize or do anything to improve the situation. When we try to talk to her or help bear the load, she literally slams the door on us.</p> <p>This was some rant, but it&#39;s denver local and I&#39;d like some advice from locals who organize.</p> <p>So, I have 3 questions:</p> <p>Is there any way I can get through to her?</p> <p>Is there anything I can do from the outside to try to improve the situation, to do the organizing for her, or make a picket, or something?</p> <p>Do I just resign myself to getting CoViD eventually and watching my family get sick too?</p> <p>Plz remove if not <a href="/r/Denverprotest">r/Denverprotest</a> material.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Berathor113"> /u/Berathor113 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ja6asr/covid_in_schools_and_i_dont_know_how_to_help/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ja6asr/covid_in_schools_and_i_dont_know_how_to_help/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

It’s embarrassing that we would honor any Europ...ean for “discovering” America. Aside from the fact that giving this credit to Columbus is historically inaccurate, it’s cognitive dissonance that allowed our teachers to say “Columbus discovered America in 1492” in one breath and then to teach us about “Native Americans” in another. It should have been obvious that a man can’t discover a place where people already live. This same cognitive dissonance pervades our American identity, way of thinking and lifestyle in every single way..."-Norm Halm <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/happyindigenouspeoplesday">#HappyIndigenousPeoplesDay</a> ✊🏾🖤💯📚🔥</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

I&#39;d imagine the final straw was related to the shooting after his event.</p> <p>He&#39;s still up on Twitter, but these bans tend to happen in waves across social media, so I don&#39;t see his Twitter having a lot of time left. Instagram and Facebook were his primary outlets to organize things, and if Twitter (where he has 46.8k followers) gets him too, he&#39;ll be knocked down to just 3.9k followers on Parler (basically Nazi Twitter, for anyone out of the loop).</p> <p>This is actually a significant blow to right-wing organizing in Denver.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HolidayInn-Cambodia"> /u/HolidayInn-Cambodia </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ja1czo/small_victories/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ja1czo/small_victories/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

This recognit...ion results from grassroots struggle to reclaim history for the people.</p><p> European colonizers arrived to the land now known as the Americas more than 500 years ago. This marked the beginning of the brutal pillage and enslavement of entire continents of people. Holidays which commemorate Christopher Columbus whitewash the genocide they spearheaded.</p><p> The passage of time does not guarantee progress. After centuries of exploitation, Indigenous people in the United States face very high rates of poverty, sickness, incarceration, and theft of natural resources.</p><p> Take the example of Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota. Pine Ridge is the site of the Wounded Knee Massacre of 1890, where U.S. soldiers murdered hundreds of Plains Native Americans, including children, women and men.</p><p> Today, the brutality continues but with silent causes. The area has the highest infant mortality rate in the country — 300 percent the national average.</p><p> Life expectancy for men on the reservation is just 48 years, and for women, 52 years.</p><p> It was within this context that on Feb. 27, 1973, the American Indian Movement began the 71-day occupation of Wounded Knee to spread awareness of historical and ongoing injustices to Indigenous people.</p><p> The U.S. government waged all-out war against AIM.</p><p> Just as they set out to destroy the Black Panthers and others, the FBI was determined to kill, imprison Native liberation leaders. They falsified evidence to unjustly convict AIM organizer Leonard Peltier, resulting in two life sentences.</p><p> Held at a maximum security prison in Florida, for 44 years Peltier is being deprived of necessary facilities and is seeking compassionate release or commutation of his Free Leonard Peltier! Free all political prisoners!</p><p> Many countries in Latin America had similar colonial-born holidays marking the anniversary of their conquest. On his third voyage in 1498, Columbus planted the flag of Spain in present-day Venezuela.</p><p> The 1999 election of Hugo Chavez to presidency sparked the beginning of the Bolivarian Movement that nationalized the country’s oil and created major social programs that lifted millions out of poverty.</p><p> In 2002 Chávez declared Oct 12 as Día de la Resistencia Indígena, the Day of Indigenous Resistance. Columbus’ statue was torn down two years later and the colonizer was tried in a court of public justice. Today not a single statue of Columbus remains.</p><p> Long live Indigenous resistance! Long live the struggle for liberation!</p><p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/indigenouspeoplesday2020">#IndigenousPeoplesDay2020</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Statement on Saturday&#39;s Counter Protest</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/j9xr9z/statement_on_saturdays_counter_protest/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>On Saturday, October 10th, the Denver Communists, W.I.T.C.H. Denver, the Front Range Mutual Aid Network, Colorado Socialist Revolution, and others held a rally to oppose and confront a fascist militia gathering. Canned and dry foods were collected and hot meals were cooked and served. We also set up tables under canopies to facilitate political conversation, distribute Marxist literature, and invite the people we meet to organize with us to grow the anti-racist, anti-fascist movement. By midafternoon all of our goals had been accomplished--most importantly our counter protest had outnumbered, drowned out, and driven off the fascist rally. </p> <p>As the ‘patriots’ shuffled off in defeat, a little over an hour after their assembly began, one of them struck, maced, and was subsequently shot and killed by another person. The best information we have is that the shooter was a Pinkerton security contractor employed by 9News, the local NBC affiliate. It has also come out that the person who was killed had violently attacked a Black Lives Matter protestor last summer and was aggressively confronting a Black man moments before the shooting. While we support the right to self-defense and encourage emancipatory collective self-defense independent of the capitalist state by the working class and the oppressed, we believe that our best defense is built with mass organization, not by individual acts of violence. Throughout the history of fascist and far-right organizing, mass movements of oppressed working class people mobilized to oppose them. This has proven to be the most effective, unequivocal and powerful solution. </p> <p>Our experience on Saturday bears this out. Without firing a shot, or even connecting with a soup can, we were able to effectively repel the gathering of III%ers, Oath Keepers, Proud Boys, and other white nationalists, while building closer contacts with other workers looking to organize against racism, fascism, and capitalism more broadly. Some media outlets reporting on the event, including the one who employed the alleged shooter, imply that the Denver Communists and others involved in opposing the far-right gathering were responsible for the shooting. This isn’t just incorrect, it inverts the situation entirely--had they been able to assemble without our opposition, the militia-fascists would have felt more empowered to exercise violence, not less. </p> <p>The police don’t do anything to stand against fascist violence-- not on Saturday nor this entire summer of mass uprising, not to speak of the historical camaraderie between cops and fascists. We’ve seen them work hand-in-hand with the armed right wing in Kenosha, Portland, and Minneapolis. It’s no different here in Denver where even when the police aren’t directly coordinating with militias and white-nationalist groups they’re always ready to defend them. On Saturday, while we fed the hungry with soup and communist politics, it was no coincidence that the police were facing our rally and kept their backs turned to the armed vigilantes behind them. We can’t rely on the state to oppose reactionary politics. Instead we seek to organize masses of workers to protect ourselves, our communities, and each other.</p> <p>If we recognize that our power to combat fascism comes from masses organized against it, that also means that our orientation needs to be to the public. While we acknowledge the importance of security and safeguarding those involved in organizing with us, we believe that many have mistaken obscurity with security. Instead, the Denver Communists are committed to organizing publicly, openly, and confidently. We don’t see any other way to grow the large, combative social movements that are necessary to fight the increasingly deadly status quo. After the success of the BLM-Antifa Soup Drive, we look forward to confronting the far right again the next time they rear their ugly heads. We encourage anyone interested in getting involved to attend our next meeting, over Zoom this Wednesday, where we’ll discuss our approach to organizing against the far right.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/denversocialists"> /u/denversocialists </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/j9xr9z/statement_on_saturdays_counter_protest/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/j9xr9z/statement_on_saturdays_counter_protest/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

Due to the lack of a stimulus package negotiation, millions of Americans aren&#39;t only suffering from Covid; they are suffering from poverty. What Harris said is the middle finger to all who are essential workers. They would let us die like good boys and girls, just for them to virtue signal our causes. While poverty has exploded, these politicians can eat brunch in their mansions.

Canned and dry foods were collected and hot meals were cooked and served. We also set up tables under canopies to facilitate political conversation, distribute Marxist literature, and invite the people we meet to organize with us to grow the anti-racist, anti-fascist movement.

Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians), Senior Native Affairs Advisor for the National Indigenous Women&#39;s Resource Center; and Alvin Warren,(Santa Clara Pueblo) former cabinet secretary of Indian Affairs for the State of New Mexico.

Previously the City Council President has approved an IPD proclamation but that was just a 1 day declaration each year. This resolution means this is now a done deal in Colorado Springs! Kateri Kerwin, Navajo Nation, LCSW and co-chair of the Native Advisory Council will be doing the invocation. </p> <p>Due to COVID restrictions we are not able to go inside but the meeting will be live streamed. We will meet outside of city hall to give our loudest lilililililis or lulululus when the vote passes. We asked that they make sure the windows are open so they can hear us! We will then take a celebratory walk to the MMIW mural (just a couple blocks away) and spread our Indigenousness all over downtown. Masks required to keep our relatives safe! </p> <p>Allies &amp; accomplices welcome! But you better bring your people&#39;s version of a lilili too!</p> <p><em>Type of Event:</em> Rally</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <h3>October 14-17</h3> <p><strong>7:00 AM - 10:00 PM</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/some_ehhl/status/1314330242530439168">Race &amp; Homelessness Vigil</a> (Twitter post)</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> Denver Homeless Out Loud</p> <p><em>Location:</em> 1437 Bannock St, Denver, CO</p> <p><em>Host-provided information:</em> We will be holding space in front of City Hall for 5256 minutes (equaling 89 hours) to honor and stand for every BIPOC who is experiencing homelessness in Denver right now. Why 5256 minutes? There were 1752 BIPOC people experiencing homelessness counted in Denver in January 2020. This is a known undercount. To honor everyone, not just those counted, we are tripling this number to have one minute for those counted and two minutes for all those not counted. Join us to peacefully gather and make your voice hear. If you have your own gear (sleeping bag, tarp, tent, etc) feel free to bring your own. However, we do not know what will happen with police response, so if needed to hold this space we may end up staying with minimal survival gear. If you do not have your own gear we will likely have some that you can borrow while staying at the vigil.</p> <p><em>Type of Event:</em> Vigil</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <h3>October 17</h3> <p><strong>1:00 PM - 4:00 PM</strong> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2721901238065765">COS Black&amp;Pink Card Writing in Solidarity</a> (Facebook event)</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> Colorado No More Prisons</p> <p><em>Location:</em> Chinook Center (2551 Airport Rd #107, Colorado Springs, CO)</p> <p><em>Host-provided information:</em> Join the Colorado Springs chapter of Black and Pink for solidarity and birthday card writing to LGBTQ prisoners in Colorado!

We will be taking some time to figure out how we can all best move forward with our advocacy work. </p> <p>Mission Statement: The Denver Solidarity Rides are hosted by a collective of cyclists in the Mile High City.

The sweep... began at 14th Ave and Logan St ending at 14th Ave and N Clarkson St on Thursday. <br /> Every morning around 2:30am a metal chainlink fence was built around the targeted encampment. The police, the private-contracted clean-up company Environmental Hazmat Services, the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure (formerly public works), and more, showed up around 5:30 each morning forcing the residents to pack-up and move. When our local reporter and community members asked the police multiple times where the residents could move to, they said they didn't know. <br /> On Monday, before the three-day sweep began, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Denver, Mayor Michael Hancock, CO Governor Jared Polis, Environmental Hazmat Services, and multiple police officers and state troopers for violating constitutional rights of unhoused individuals, and violating the agreed upon settlement from Lyall v City of Denver during these ongoing sweeps. The lawsuit was filed by Andrew McNaulty of Killmer, Lane and Newman, LLP on behalf of Denver Homeless Out Loud, 10 unhoused individuals, and all others similarly situated.</p><p> Stay tuned for updates and more media.</p><p> If you appreciate our coverage, please consider supporting us: <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/donate/">https://unicornriot.ninja/donate/</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Like many of you, we have been feeling the need for better organization and information dissemination around activism in Colorado. After discussing with comrades and thinking this over, we think that something like a community activism hub would be really valuable and, if well designed and maintained, would fill many of the needs that aren&#39;t currently being well met. Below is a list of requirements/components for the hub. We&#39;re thinking that a website would be the best platform, but am open to other suggestions. </p> <p>Here&#39;s what we need from you: * If you or someone you know has tech expertise and can volunteer time to help design and implement this idea, please DM me. * We will also need volunteers to help generate content and monitor/maintain the site...kind of like the reddit mod role.<br/> * Lastly, if you would like to add to or change any of the requirements, please leave a comment below.</p> <p>We help us, let&#39;s make this happen!</p> <p>List of requirements/components for Colorado Activism Hub: - Searchable, taggable calendar of events (events ideally would be well-formatted and each have a risk rating) - Ability for members of the public to submit events for inclusion in the hub calendar - Searchable database of organizations and groups, with a page for each organization - List of causes (such as BLM, homelessness, LGBTQIA, etc.) - List of active fundraisers and drives, with the ability for members of the public to submit fundraisers for approval - List of ways to help (mutual aid, donating, letter-writing, etc) - Beginner&#39;s guide to protesting, mutual aid, etc. - List of educational resources - Twitter RSS feed for key organizers in the Denver area, and relevant hashtags</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/denverprotestsdaily"> /u/denverprotestsdaily </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/j825zd/ideas_and_volunteers_needed_colorado_activism_hub/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/j825zd/ideas_and_volunteers_needed_colorado_activism_hub/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

Some residents of this camp at 19th and Welton shared with us today how they were kicked out of the Samaritan House Family shelter for having “stayed their time” and, after calling all other family shelters and signing up for section 8 lottery, they are now on ...the streets with no other options of where to go.

It is time we start using our brains and our hearts, instead of continuing this shameful whack-a-mole. </p><p> Contact City Council to ask for support for our budget proposals for housing and sanitation resources. <a href="https://denverhomelessoutloud.org/2020/10/07/denver-budget-proposals-2021/">https://denverhomelessoutloud.org/…/denver-budget-proposal…/</a></p><p> Please come and support our unhoused community members at 19th and Welton and support residents of this encampment as they demand real housing or places where they are allowed to survive.<br /> Bring the following things to assist residents:<br /> -Truck, or any vehicle to help move<br /> -Carts<br /> -Bungee Cords/Rope<br /> -Trash Bags<br /> -Food<br /> -Coffee/CoCo<br /> -Water<br /> Your assistance is much appreciated!

🚨Community Alert🚨<br />
The Aurora Fire Chief notified council members of a COVID-19 outbreak at the GEO detention facility this afternoon. There are 19 confirmed positive cases! We know we can't count on GEO to keep our community members who are detained safe. We demand that GEO releases as many folks as possible on humanitarian parole and ensures that those who are sick receive the proper medical care! We will keep monitoring the situation and connect with folks inside the facility to ensure their health and safety. <br />

How can we trust the same Chief Wilson who refuses to fire the killer cops who murdered Elijah McClain and 17th District Attorney Dave Young who refuses to press murder charges against them? Dave Young would rather press kidnapping charges against activists for organizing protests demanding Justice for Elijah McClain, which gained international attention, than press charges against violent cops.</p><a href="https://denver.cbslocal.com/2020/09/29/shataean-kelly-levi-huffine-aurora-police-video-released-woman-struggling-back-patrol-car/">Aurora's chief said bodycam video appears to show one of her former officers, Levi Huffine, "punishing" a female prisoner.<img src="https://external.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQCFhLQBHJzZwbih&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdenver.cbslocal.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F15909806%2F2020%2F09%2Fvideo-aurora-police.jpg%3Fw%3D1500&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQDM_MSXWOqk1PAB" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>denver.cbslocal.com</p><p>Aurora Police Video Released Of Woman Cuffed, Hogtied In Back Of Patrol Car: 'Please Don't Let Me Die Back Here'</p>Aurora's chief said bodycam video appears to show one of her former officers, Levi Huffine, "punishing" a female prisoner.<a href="https://denver.cbslocal.com/2020/09/29/shataean-kelly-levi-huffine-aurora-police-video-released-woman-struggling-back-patrol-car/">Aurora's chief said bodycam video appears to show one of her former officers, Levi Huffine, "punishing" a female prisoner.</a>]]></content:encoded>

These two comrades showed immense bravery in coming and speaking out against the injustice and cruelty of the criminal justice system, which they’ve now experienced firsthand. Joel would have absolutely been there too if he didn...'t have to be out of town! </p><p> Despite the incredibly difficult experience of going through jail and facing the upcoming battle to drop the over 30 serious charges that these organizers collectively face, they have not been intimidated by the repressive and violent forces of DPD, APD, and the 18th and 17th district attorneys. Their resolve has only been made stronger against the injustice that they and all prisoners and victims of police violence face. </p><p> Lillian spoke about the meaning of solidarity, telling the crowd how Eliza told her lawyer that if bond was posted for her before Lillian, she would insist on staying in jail despite the horrible torturous conditions she faced until Lillian was released too. </p><p> Eliza spoke of the need to continue the struggle against police terror now more than ever, saying "Let it be known - they wouldn't come after us if this movement didn't SCARE them!" </p><p> The battle to drop the charges is only beginning and everyone in the movement must come together in solidarity at this time to challenge an enemy with more resources but not more numbers, an enemy that uses the power of violence but is no match for the power of the people! </p><p> In the words of Assata Shakur: “We must love and support one another, we have nothing to lose but our chains!”</p><p> And in the words of Lillian House: “Our determination is so much greater than our fear. Our solidarity is so much greater than the repression. I have never felt more confident that we have what it takes to go the distance. WE WILL WIN"</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1039416439844179">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1039416439844179/1040214076431082/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/120344997_1040214079764415_2592424513991444533_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=TLBKEY19gr4AX9YSmBf&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=a2ec09a52287d0def1fe35d1d4e9a1f8&oe=5FAC6DD1" alt="Image may contain: 1 person, standing" width="500" height="376" caption="Image may contain: 1 person, standing" /></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1039416439844179/1040214233097733/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p235x165/120442612_1040214239764399_7821939980886648424_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=q0U41QQ6ISsAX-kE5p6&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=c4a9cbab2c6105e5a031d1894b215857&oe=5FAACF94" alt="Image may contain: 1 person, standing and outdoor" width="293" height="165" caption="Image may contain: 1 person, standing and outdoor" /></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1039416439844179/1040214213097735/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p235x165/120338934_1040214216431068_4229693215610610667_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=9JK7qx-nr4UAX9ZVBaj&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=e577f97a3b80006c0534fcbee07bdf0c&oe=5FAA42D0" alt="Image may contain: 3 people, people standing and outdoor" width="293" height="165" caption="Image may contain: 3 people, people standing and outdoor" /></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1039416439844179/1040214086431081/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p235x165/120371184_1040214089764414_157915028763270256_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=sZFUTlHZxhoAX9lpasx&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=766dacd308be0ac2b5afaede3678285e&oe=5FA9C58D" alt="Image may contain: one or more people, crowd and outdoor" width="293" height="165" caption="Image may contain: one or more people, crowd and outdoor" />+4</a>]]></content:encoded>

We demand their immediate freedom and that the charges against them be dropped.</p><p> On Sept. 17, several protest leaders, including four members of the Party for Socialism and Liberation, were arrested in Denver, Colorado in a coordinated police attack. The org...anizers now face over 30 bogus charges including “kidnapping” and “inciting a riot,” and potentially years in prison. They were targeted because of their dedicated organizing efforts in recent months to denouncing the police murder of Elijah McClain in Aurora, Colorado.</p><p> The same District Attorney, Dave Young, who has refused to charge the police officers who murdered Elijah McClain, directed these felony arrests of the organizers who have been protesting against him. He is engaged in a corrupt abuse of his authority to silence his critics and the demands for racial justice, a declaration of war against the First Amendment.</p><p> This attack goes hand in hand with the assault on the anti-racist movement directed from the White House, from Governor’s mansions, and from local police departments around the country.</p><p> We understand that this can happen to any protester, who has used their voice to mobilize in the mass movement against racism in every single corner of the United States. We stand united against this attack on civil liberties and the ongoing movement for Black Lives.</p><p> Demands:<br /> Free the anti-racist organizers from jail immediately!<br /> Drop all the charges!<br /> Stop the assault on the movement and on free speech!<br /> In solidarity,<br /> Add your name here: <a href="https://www.pslweb.org/denverorgsolidarity">https://www.pslweb.org/denverorgsolidarity</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SURJDenver/posts/2706885716252251">See More</a><a href="https://www.pslweb.org/denverorgsolidarity">We are calling on all individuals and organizations who care about justice and free speech to unite in this fight to defend the protest movement, and free these Denver-area organizers.

This site was posted for a sweep the same day as residents from 25th and Arapahoe moved to this site in search of anywhere to be. 25th and Welton is currently home to another 60 or so people without housing. Most of the residents on the right of way strip on 25th have been living there for many months. Others living in the parking lot area have moved there recently after other sweeps. </p><p> Residents of these encampments all ask the same question: where are we supposed to go?? The City has done nothing to get these people access to housing. They are not even being offered hotel rooms through the COVID FEMA funding. They are being told to either go to a shelter or go to jail. </p><p> Come support residents of these encampments as they demand real housing or places where they are allowed to survive. </p><p> Bring the following things to assist residents: </p><p> -Truck, or any vehicle to help move</p><p> -Carts</p><p> -Bungee Cords/Rope</p><p> -Trash Bags</p><p> -Food</p><p> -Coffee/CoCo</p><p> -Water</p><p> Your assistance is much appreciated!

Their civil rights are also being violated with Denver, Adams and Arapahoe County working together to deny our comrades a bond hearing. Our comrades suffer yet they are still thinking of others &mdash; constantly telling communjty about the conditions of their cell mates and others in the jail and agitating for their release as well. @justiceforelijahmcclain PSL Denver and Say Their Names 5280 are heroes and freedom fighters.

In a SINGLE DAY A quarter million dollars were paid out to APD and Adams County officers just to try to intimidate us with fences and riot gear. That day, APD also tried to make our indigenous comrades drop their prayer sticks to enter on Oakland Street and when our comrades told APD, &quot;You're in riot gear and have batons! Let us have our prayer sticks or we are gonna sue the shit out of you!&quot; <br />
<br />
Why does APD continue to do private security for Aurora GEO? La policia, la migra, misma porqueria!<br />

Naturally, this was an extremely traumatizing event, and I preferred to spare the details from the world partly for privacy but mostly for shame. What they did to me was not only cruel and unusual, but I would even go so far as to call those men’s actions that night pure evil. But tonight I am forced to share with you all this in hopes you will stand in solidarity with me as I stand trial against felony charges that could land me years in prison. It would mean the world to me if you all could take a few minutes to read this and repost my story if you feel comfortable with that.</p><p> The reason I feel forced to share my story, or even share prematurely is because of the circumstances of this trial. The night of the protest I was arrested for “disarming a peace officer” - they say I stole a pepper ball gun from one of the officers. Disclaimer, I didn't… but I’ll get to that later - After being discharged from jail due to my deteriorating medical condition, I quickly found an excellent law firm to help represent me. Over the next 4 weeks, my legal team visited DPD twice a day, requesting all the evidence such as footage from a street surveillance camera, and the officer's body cams. When they did not comply, I turned to my friends in the political realm. After a few state legislators reached out on my behalf, for the most part we were met with silence. As privileged as I was to have these politicians advocating for me, DPD still would not budge. The only discovery presented by the police so far, 6 weeks after my arrest, is a probable cause statement-making claims that can be quickly and easily disproved by a video of the arrest that night, provided by a fellow protestor. In all the years my lawyers have been practicing in Colorado, they have never once seen evidence be withheld to such a degree. And with all the stories of shady arrests going down, it is honestly starting to scare me.</p><p> Unfortunately, now I know what a panic attack feels like. I now know the tight squeezing feeling that grips my chest, that the doctors call anxiety. The fact that I can't live without an irrational fear of being outside alone at night (something women have ALWAYS to deal with!!!!). The reason for this is because of the exact way the arrest went down that night. It was without any warning nor any chance to cooperate. I was grabbed from behind while I was standing, leaning against a fence. What happened next occurred in the blink of an eye. I was thrown to the ground face first. All of a sudden I started getting beaten by several officers, kicked and hit with a baton. I was grabbed by the hair on my scalp, my head was lifted off the ground, and I was punched multiple times in the face. My muffled screams for my girlfriend, for any help, were quickly snuffed out. Then an officer decided to take his baton, and forcibly shove it into my rectum. My “fight or flight, friend or freeze” instincts kicked in, and my body went numb. Everything that happened after that felt like a blur. I begged and pleaded for them to tell me what I had done wrong and why I was being arrested, but the only response I received was being told “We don’t gotta tell you SHIT… shut the FUCK up”</p><p> After spending the night in the hospital concussed and handcuffed to my gurney, I was finally thrown in jail. The worst of my charges: disarming an officer??? and violently resisting arrest?!? All absolutely untrue. I did not do it, and there is a video that shows all of this. My deepest gratitude goes out to the unnamed protestor who reached out with the video. I am not a violent man. Peace is my first language, anyone who knows me can tell you that.</p><p> These officers must face the law. I still don't even know the names of my assaulters. They remain anonymous, STILL ON DUTY. How long until they sexually assault another victim, or even murder someone. How long until another “hashtag”.</p><p> Please share this. If you feel comfortable, even share a short story, or some time you have personally witnessed the amount of love I pour into activism, and this community… I live to help. Tag Jared Polis. Tag Mayor Hancock. Tag DA Beth Mccann, DPD, tag em all. Community, I need you all now more than ever. I love you all. Thank you.</p><p> Link to video of arrest: <a href="https://streamable.com/3pn8wa">https://streamable.com/3pn8wa</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

Black men is unacceptable. Property can be replaced, Black Lives cannot," she maintains.</p><p> ...</p><p> “The arrests are violent, resulting in broken bones and other serious injuries. The criminal charges are being inflated to increasingly serious offenses. Protesters are being forced to risk their safety and freedom in order to exercise their right to free speech," said Jessica Jones — a local criminal defense attorney and volunteer organizer for the Colorado NLG. "It is a sad paradox that protesters experience police violence as they protest police violence."</p><p> In addition to violent policing tactics in the name of crowd-control, Denver Police recently began invoking a little-used ordinance that was originally passed in anticipation of the 2008 Democratic National Convention protests. The law bans activists from carrying protective equipment, chains, and bike locks.</p><p> "This ordinance has allowed police to criminalize activists before a protest has even started," said Jones.</p><p> <a href="https://www.westword.com/news/denver-protest-arrests-likened-to-minority-report-11797388">https://www.westword.com/…/denver-protest-arrests-likened-t…</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php">See More</a><a href="https://www.westword.com/news/denver-protest-arrests-likened-to-minority-report-11797388">Possession of a helmet can allegedly lead to an arrest.<img src="https://external.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDOHMSP4BLR8TPy&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages1.westword.com%2Fimager%2Fu%2Foriginal%2F11798121%2Fprotest_may30_eps_02.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQAD8Tds3vkIjeOM" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>westword.com</p><p>Claim: Denver Police Busting Protesters for Protecting Themselves</p>Possession of a helmet can allegedly lead to an arrest.<a href="https://www.westword.com/news/denver-protest-arrests-likened-to-minority-report-11797388">Possession of a helmet can allegedly lead to an arrest.</a>]]></content:encoded>

Last night, in a last-minute mobilization, 125 gathered with Antonio Blackbear’s mother, wife, daughter, aunt, and other relative...s to protest his murder by Denver Police two days ago.</p><p> We began with an Indigenous prayer and remarks from family members, including Lynn Eagle Feather, Antonio’s hunka (adopted) aunt, whose son, Paul Castaway, was also murdered by Denver Police five years ago. </p><p> With friendly cars following us, we marched a mile from the Capitol Building past the downtown police headquarters and chanted “Cops! Pigs! Murderers!” at the cops guarding the fence they erected around it. We asked them, “Which one of you killed Antonio Blackbear?” and later, when we confronted some sheriff’s deputies, “Which one of you killed Michael Marshall?”</p><p> At the site of Antonio’s murder, family members gathered around a candle-filled memorial and told the crowd about their lost relative. Antonio’s mother expressed how touched she was by the presence of so many who were outraged by the shooting. It was painful to witness yet another family reeling from the shock of the police taking the life of their beloved relative.</p><p> The march returned to the Capitol and happened to pass a Starbucks along the way, the windows of which proved to be an irresistible temptation. After most of us had dispersed and gone home, two truckloads of riot cops advanced on those that remained. They were clearly coming for a couple of protestors and we were unable to prevent them from doing so. Two were arrested and won’t be able to be bailed out until Monday. Donations for bail can be made to Colorado Freedom Fund: <a href="https://fundly.com/coloradofreedom">https://fundly.com/coloradofreedom</a></p><p> Thank you to Antonio’s family, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nativelivesmatter1/">Native Lives Matter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AnonResistanceMovement/">Anon Resistance Movement</a>, and all who showed up against racist police violence!</p><p> “When Indigenous lives are under attack, what do we do?

And they won’t stop until we stop them! On Wednesday, Sept 9, they shot and killed..." /></a><br><br>Denver Police have killed again! And they won&rsquo;t stop until we stop them! On Wednesday, Sept 9, they shot and killed Antonio Blackbear, a 41-year-old Lakota man.<br />
<br />
Antonio was the adopted cousin of another Lakota man killed by the Denver Police five years ago, Paul Castaway. Indigenous people are more likely than any other racial group to be killed by police. <br />
<br />
There has been no semblance of justice for Paul in that time, since Denver District Attorneys, like their counterparts around the nation, refuse to hold police accountable for the violent, racist terror that forms the very core of their job description. We expect the fight for justice for Antonio to be a similarly difficult one.<br />
<br />
The police have yet to release video of their killing of Antonio, nor say much about it, because they are working to craft a story that casts them in the best light.<br />
<br />
Justice for Antonio Blackbear!<br />
Defund, disarm, and disband the police!]]></content:encoded>

As you may know, Sza Sza Codner or Jennifer Codner is a Jamaican trans woman detained at Aurora Contract Detention Facility.<br />
<br />
Sza Sza endured violence and persecution in her country of origin which drove her to seek asylum and refuge here. Since then she's been ferried from one immigrant prison to the other, subjected to solitary confinement, targeting and harassment from guards, placed in men's facilities, and a host of other horrible atrocities.<br />
Help end her indefinite imprisonment by pushing for her release.<br />
<br />
Sza Sza has court this Friday, 9/11 and we are determined to assist in getting her out of detention and towards safety.]]></content:encoded>

Though an appeal to the state Supreme Court is in the works, this means that potentially for most of this winter, the criminal punishment system will deny our unhoused neighb...ors the basic human right to not only safe, affordable housing but to camp undisturbed without having their homes and property "swept" and stolen/trashed under the orders of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverdoti/">Denver Department of Transportation and Infrastructure</a> or the Denver Department of Public Health and Environment. (Let's be real, though - we know you're behind these orders, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/5280mayor/">Michael B. Hancock</a>).</p><p> A recent study by the municipal public defender's office found that 30% of the people caught in the revolving door of the municipal court system are Black (Denver is 10% Black), and that 38% of total municipal court cases involve unhoused people charged with minor, nonviolent violations directly related to homelessness.</p><p> Racial justice is intersectional justice - please continue to support organizations like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/coloradodashr/">Denver Alliance for Street Health Response</a> who work with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/">Denver Homeless Out Loud</a> to ensure that our unhoused neighbors have what they need to survive this winter. <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/supporting-dashr039s-community-response">https://www.gofundme.com/f/supporting-dashr039s-community-r…</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SURJDenver/posts/2692175781056578">See More</a><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/supporting-dashr039s-community-response">Denver Alliance for Street Health Response (DASHR) is an organization focused o… Vinnie Cervantes needs your support for Supporting DASHR's Community Response<img src="https://external.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net%2F48934810_1592509035270542_r.jpeg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQCTnGRYfVscS9Iz" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>gofundme.com</p><p>Supporting DASHR's Community Response, organized by Vinnie Cervantes</p>Denver Alliance for Street Health Response (DASHR) is an organization focused o… Vinnie Cervantes needs your support for Supporting DASHR's Community Response<a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/supporting-dashr039s-community-response">Denver Alliance for Street Health Response (DASHR) is an organization focused o… Vinnie Cervantes needs your support for Supporting DASHR's Community Response</a>]]></content:encoded>

Last Wednesday, when 40+ DPD officers brutalized community members assisting unhoused neighbors with sweeps, we drew a line in the sand. Enough is enough!</p><p> We demand justice for our unhoused neighbors, as well as the families of William Debose, Alexis Mendez-Perez, Paul Castaway, Michael Marshall, Marvin Booker, Ryan Ronquillo, Jessie Hernandez and the thousands of people in our city impacted by state-backed violence. The Denver City Council has failed to hear our calls for justice, liberation and abolition. We know that human rights only come alive when citizens organize, protest, boycott, rebel and violate the law in order to uphold justice!</p><p> Twelve comrades were arrested last night. Some were released on PR bond but we still have 3 bonds of $500 each to pay and two comrades with bond not allowed until court on Monday afternoon. Please help raise the ransom for these brave rebels and get them out of cages with an active COVID outbreak! Let's get our comrades back to their loved ones, their pets and their jobs tonight!</p><p> As the election approaches, we are looking to make an active bail fund for rebels. Any excess monies will be put into this revolving fund as we work to create it!

(Hint: we think it should include abolishing the police.) <br /> We share many others' skepticism about task forces like these, but we know and respect many of the conveners of this forum..., we believe in community engagement even when skepticism is warranted, and as the saying goes, "if you're not at the table, you're probably on the menu." So we hope to see many people attending with a critical eye and an open mind.

Por que la comunidad Negra está marchando y protestando en estos momentos? Porque la policía sigue matando a la gente Negra. Porque la patrulla fronteriza está matando a nuestra gente en la frontera entonces mi llamado ahorita en nuestra comunidad es pensar más allá de nosotros, hacer todas las conecciones, tomar las calles, organizarnos para que toda esta violencia puede terminar. Y ustedes como Univisión tienen responsabilidad de contar toda la historia de todo lo que esta pasando así como hablamos de las deportaciones ustedes también tienen que hablar por que la gente sigue muriendo en manos de la policía, particularmente la gente Negra. Ese es mi llamado. En este momento hacer negocio con esta administración es una traición a la comunidad Negra y a las familias que siguen muriendo."</p><p> ******<br /> Sign the petition to demand Univisión and Telemundo stop their antiBlack coverage:  <a href="https://bit.ly/lasvidasnegrasimportan">bit.ly/lasvidasnegrasimportan</a>  </p><p> "I understand that there is going to be a lot of pain right now for our community but we also have a responsibility to make connections between everything that is happening. Why is the Black community marching and protesting right now? Because the police are still killing Black people. Because border patrol is killing our people. So my call to action right now in our community is to think beyond us, make these connections, take to the streets, and organize so that all this violence can end. And you as Univision have a responsibility to tell the whole story of everything that is happening, just like how we talk about deportations, you also have to talk about why people keep dying at the hands of the police, particularly Black people. That is my call to action. Right now doing business with this administration is a betrayal of the Black community and the families that continue to die.

We see this new community-driven service as a form of preventative medicine for police violence. If it had been in place long ...ago, could have prevented the deaths of Elijah McClain, Michael Marshall, Paul Castaway, Paul Childs, and countless other victims of police violence in Denver. <br /> Abolition is not a metaphor - it's a tangible possibility, and this is an important example of how our communities can start to build the alternatives to modern policing that we need to keep our communities safe. We can have a world without police. We can have a world without prisons.
