      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Please see our <a href="https://mailfence.com/pub/cal/denverprotestsdaily?a=1">new calendar</a> for the most complete list of upcoming vetted events. </p> <p>Events are color coded as follows:</p> <ul> <li>red: rally/protest/march</li> <li>purple: campaign (an event allowing activity spanning across several days)</li> <li>blue: government meeting</li> <li>yellow: education/training</li> <li>green: news</li> <li>orange: panel</li> <li>black: vigil</li> <li>pink: mutual aid</li> </ul> <h1>Wiki</h1> <p>To avoid repeating too much information from day to day, we&#39;ve created the beginnings of a wiki <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/wiki/index">here</a>. Your feedback is much needed, as this is my (TaroPeril&#39;s) first experience with a reddit wiki. It contains links to livestreamers, your rights as a protestor, and more.</p> <h1>News</h1> <p>DPD shot two men in the span of 72 hours last week - <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/09/11/denver-police-shooting-west-high-school-identified/">Antonio Blackbear, the cousin of Paul Castaway</a> on September 10 and then <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/09/12/denver-police-shooting-saturday-west-colfax/">one as-of-yet unnamed man</a> on September 12. Then, they broke up a memorial service for Antonio Blackbear on the night of Friday, September 11, and <a href="https://twitter.com/__ovas__/status/1304662954735030272?s=20">arrested several protestors</a>. </p> <p>The Denver City Council will also be voting on the collective bargaining proposal agreed upon by Mayor Hancock and DPD. This proposal guarantees a 2.77% raise for all of DPD, at a time when other city departments are being furloughed and otherwise having their budgets slashed. <a href="https://www.westword.com/news/denver-city-council-poised-to-reject-police-bargaining-agreement-11788153">Five councilmembers have so far stated publicly that they will vote against this proposal</a>, which was negotiated behind closed doors. Only two more councilmembers are needed for a majority. If they turn down this proposal, this will be the first time ever that such an agreement has been rejected by the City Council. Contact your rep today!</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://sentinelcolorado.com/news/metro/aurora-council-committee-axes-2-proposals-approves-another-targeting-military-devices-tear-gas/">Aurora City Council axed a proposal by CM Marcano to ban the use of tear gas and other military-grade equipment by APD</a>. Marcano plans to edit the measure and bring it forward again. Mayor Coffman, of course, wrote that &quot;I believe that having these additional tools makes it less likely that our police department would ever have to resort to options that could cause physical injury, such as the use of wooden billy clubs, that can cause bone fractures, or rubber bullets, that can cause permanent loss of an eye, to accomplish the same purpose of (dispersing) a crowd (that) is becoming violent.” Did he not see that APD used everything at its disposal at various protests in Aurora this summer?</p> <p>A group called Community E also led a group of about 30 protestors <a href="https://sentinelcolorado.com/news/metro/demonstrators-confront-aurora-lawmaker-at-her-home-sunday-protesting-death-of-elijah-mcclain/">to the home of CM Bergan to protest the death of Elijah McClain</a>. There will be future protests. As this one was not sanctioned by the mother of Elijah McClain, it was not added to the calendar, but if future ones focus on other topics, they will be added to this thread and to the calendar.</p> <h1>Notable Events</h1> <h3>September 14</h3> <p><strong>4:00 PM - 6:00 PM</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/afrofrontco/status/1301688029447434240?s=21">Can You Hear Us Now?</a> (Twitter post)</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> Afro Liberation Front</p> <p><em>Location:</em> East steps of City Hall (1437 Bannock St, Denver, CO)</p> <p><em>Host-provided information:</em> Currently, the city charter of Denver prohibits bargaining over officers’ discipline, policing policies, and oversight.

Last night, in a last-minute mobilization, 125 gathered with Antonio Blackbear’s mother, wife, daughter, aunt, and other relative...s to protest his murder by Denver Police two days ago.</p><p> We began with an Indigenous prayer and remarks from family members, including Lynn Eagle Feather, Antonio’s hunka (adopted) aunt, whose son, Paul Castaway, was also murdered by Denver Police five years ago. </p><p> With friendly cars following us, we marched a mile from the Capitol Building past the downtown police headquarters and chanted “Cops!

Allende and a core of his staff resisted until the fascist troops stormed the building. Allende was killed.</p><p> By afternoon, all government offices in the country were taken over. Within weeks, thousands of leftists, intellectuals, unionists and supporters of Allende were rounded up and tortured in the National Stadium. Many were executed. Congress was suspended, unions and political parties banned, and habeas corpus eliminated.</p><p> Among these desparecidos was famous Communist poet and singer Victor Jara. Born into poverty to a peasant family, by the age of 6 Jara was already working on a farm. Yet he became a distinguished theater director and played a pivotal role in establishing the Nueva Canción Chilena movement.</p><p> Before Jara was murdered, soldiers smashed his fingers and then mocked him, handed him a guitar and forced him to play a song. In a display of immense revolutionary resilience, with broken hands Jara sang the song that was the anthem of the movement, Venceremos – We Will Triumph. Jara’s life was brutally taken by army lieutenant Pedro Pablo Barrientos. Barrientos who played Russian roulette with Jara until a shot finally rang out. He was then shot another 44 times, and his body  dumped in the street along with the hundreds of others.</p><p> In his final hours, Jara composed one last song on a scrap of paper. The song ends, “How hard it is to sing when I must sing of horror... What I see, I have never seen, what I have felt and what I feel, will give birth to the moment.”</p><p> Victor Jara’s legacy will live on forever in his music and perseverance. No amount of guns, tanks, prisons, or unjust laws can stop the movement towards justice.</p><p> ¡Víctor Jara presente!</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

Last night, in a last-minute mobilization, 125 gathered with Antonio Blackbear’s mother, wife, daughter, aunt, and other relative...s to protest his murder by Denver Police two days ago.</p><p> We began with an Indigenous prayer and remarks from family members, including Lynn Eagle Feather, Antonio’s hunka (adopted) aunt, whose son, Paul Castaway, was also murdered by Denver Police five years ago. </p><p> With friendly cars following us, we marched a mile from the Capitol Building past the downtown police headquarters and chanted “Cops! Pigs! Murderers!” at the cops guarding the fence they erected around it. We asked them, “Which one of you killed Antonio Blackbear?” and later, when we confronted some sheriff’s deputies, “Which one of you killed Michael Marshall?”</p><p> At the site of Antonio’s murder, family members gathered around a candle-filled memorial and told the crowd about their lost relative. Antonio’s mother expressed how touched she was by the presence of so many who were outraged by the shooting.

On Wednesday, Sept 9, they shot and killed Antonio Blackbear, a 41-year-old Lakota man.<br />
<br />
Antonio was the adopted cousin of another Lakota man killed by the Denver Police five years ago, Paul Castaway. Indigenous people are more likely than any other racial group to be killed by police. <br />
<br />
There has been no semblance of justice for Paul in that time, since Denver District Attorneys, like their counterparts around the nation, refuse to hold police accountable for the violent, racist terror that forms the very core of their job description. We expect the fight for justice for Antonio to be a similarly difficult one.<br />
<br />
The police have yet to release video of their killing of Antonio, nor say much about it, because they are working to craft a story that casts them in the best light.<br />
<br />
Justice for Antonio Blackbear!<br />
Defund, disarm, and disband the police!]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a Denver resident, but the past few times I&#39;ve been there I&#39;ve seen a fence around areas of the capitol building along with a state trooper(s) that seem to be there 24/7. I have a few questions</p> <ol> <li>Is that fence still there?</li> <li>if the fence is there, why is it there?</li> <li>is there any push to get the fence removed?</li> </ol> <p>Obviously, that is public land and the public has a right to be there. A recent video by Cuttheplastic shows similar fences going up for no reason throughout the city. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nns1GwBX-Zc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nns1GwBX-Zc</a></p> <p>How much land is going to be restricted from the public without real justification before there&#39;s a backlash? It looks like crap, costs the taxpayers money to erect and defend, restricts freedom of movement, discourages peaceful assembly, and is all around just an oppressive message to the public specifically targeted at those who choose to exercise their 1st amendment rights,</p> <p>Like honestly, fence costs aside, how much does it cost to station a state trooper there 24/7. They must make at least $20 an hour, plus gas costs, etc. The other day I saw like 5 state police there having a fucking picnic.</p> <p>What is going on here?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Buhdumtssss"> /u/Buhdumtssss </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iqy81o/re_the_fence_around_the_capitol/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iqy81o/re_the_fence_around_the_capitol/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>City Council this Monday!</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iqt2fa/city_council_this_monday/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Alright y&#39;all, the CBA - the collective bargaining agreement aka the contract with the police union - is here and being brought before city council this Monday. It was previously discussed in a committee meeting last Wednesday where several council members were concerned about being left out of the conversation with the Denver PPA. According to the city charter, a city council representative is supposed to be involved in negotiations from the beginning but because of the current political climate, the Denver police union &quot;accidentally&quot; left them out and kept early stages of negotiations internal and private. </p> <p>Despite this, the city council committee members at Wednesday&#39;s meeting decided to send this to the floor of the city council so all city council members could vote on whether to approve the contract or send it back for arbitration. The most glaring problem with the proposed contract is that it is a two-year contract rather than one. It essentially says that Denver police will not take a pay raise or holiday bonus in 2021 but they are ensured a 2.77% salary increase in 2022. </p> <p>We ALL need to be calling and emailing our city council representatives and urging them to send the CBA back for arbitration. We know cops do not deserve this raise. And city council members know that the collective bargaining agreement was not done in good faith; it was NOT collectively discussed. Play into their egos and ask them to reclaim their power on our behalf. And sign up for public comment to speak and tell the whole council what you think! Public comment signup is today at noon and slots fill fast:</p> <p><a href="https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_3GN7Zv99SluXrlm4UC8NLQ">https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_3GN7Zv99SluXrlm4UC8NLQ</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/antitruncher"> /u/antitruncher </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iqt2fa/city_council_this_monday/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iqt2fa/city_council_this_monday/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

Name the paramedic that was involved and fire him too. Then prosecute all of them as well as the other police that commit murder.</p><p> Our protest is not about committing violence or harm of any sort. During the event, we shall deliver these demands to one of the city council members.

Some of these people moved back the night after the swe...ep, others a few days after, but in any case folks have been living on these blocks since the sweep with no indication that the area is “closed.” </p><p> At least 6 people will show up today to find all their property gone. One of these people, Van, showed up shortly after the police had just trashed, not stored, his tent and all his property. This is the same man who stood his ground against the police on one leg at the sweep two weeks ago. All of the residents of this area are scattered to nowhere...</p><p> After coming in and taking these people’s property around 12noon, one resident - David - showed up on site as the city was about to grab his property. The police agreed to give him two hours to pack and move. Just after 2pm police showed up, walked up and arrested Daivd at 2:14pm for “disobeying a lawful order” aka being 6 minutes late to move his property as he was actively in the midst of moving his property. Police did not give him any warning or any time when they walked up on him at 2:14pm to arrest him. They just threw him in handcuffs and told him he was under arrest. </p><p> A few minutes later, another man - Allen - who had just had his property taken from the city two hours earlier and walked up to it being gone, came back to the area since we had found someone to give him a ride to try to get his stuff from storage and he was immediately arrested. Police claimed he was on body camera footage threatening an officer and arrested him for “threats to an officer.” This same officer who he supposedly threatened, was caught on camera pushing his car door into Allen and grabbing his arm and pushing him back. This was all as Allen was trying to ask officers for business cards after his property had just been taken. Two hours later police proceeded to arrest him with great force and had him on the ground for over 30 minutes. </p><p> You don’t have to look any farther to see the intersection of racism, homelessness, and police brutality. Police arrested these men for NOTHING because that is what police do to homeless black people. Enough is enough.</p><p> Thanks to community members who are bailing these men out of jail. </p><p> Watch livestream and others on our facebook of these sweeps and arrests <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/videos/716517545872124/">https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/videos/716517545872124</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/1988439837952626">See More</a><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t15.13418-10/119105525_402008110787160_2075018125510989478_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&_nc_sid=f2c4d5&_nc_ohc=sXOi_agILiIAX-yQFBk&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&oh=a68a8395dc567f59b89ef7acbeadcb9d&oe=5F861B2C" /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/">Denver Homeless Out Loud</a> was live.<a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/videos/716517545872124/"></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com"><i></i></a>]]></content:encoded>

We are currently only at 1 C warming and already experiencing extreme weather and devastation around the globe. The much-touted Paris Agreement’s voluntary commitments have us on target for 3 C warming, when scientists warn that staying below 1.5 C warming is what is needed to avert catastrophe. </p><p> Despite being in charge of the wealthiest country in the world, the... U.S. government — Democrat and Republican — is doing nothing to mitigate or prepare for the looming catastrophe. Even in the liberal bastion of California, state leadership is not taking the crisis seriously. California is the fifth largest economy in the world, yet there is no money for people’s needs while Big Tech gets tax breaks.</p><p> If humanity is to survive this crisis, we must immediately put all resources into preparing for what’s currently unfolding and what’s to come. We must immediately transition off fossil fuels and restore ecosystems that capture carbon from the atmosphere. We must protect the population from climate disasters and provide real relief for people in the aftermath.</p><p> Capitalism has proven time and again that it is incapable and unwilling to meet the needs of the people. If we don’t uproot the system that has created the climate crisis, that continues to ignore it and go about business as usual, the majority of us face a truly dire not-too-distant future. The people have the power to change the path we are on — to share the challenges together and build a better world for all.”</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1025424461243377">See More</a><a href="https://www.liberationnews.org/govt-silent-as-climate-change-unfolds/#.X1pslpHoqTI.facebook">San Francisco skyline tainted orange from wildfire smoke, Sept. 9 As I write this article from San Francisco, Calif., the sky is dark orange and I need to have my desk lamp on to see, despite that it’s midday.

As you may know, Sza Sza Codner or Jennifer Codner is a Jamaican trans woman detained at Aurora Contract Detention Facility.<br />
<br />
Sza Sza endured violence and persecution in her country of origin which drove her to seek asylum and refuge here. Since then she's been ferried from one immigrant prison to the other, subjected to solitary confinement, targeting and harassment from guards, placed in men's facilities, and a host of other horrible atrocities.<br />
Help end her indefinite imprisonment by pushing for her release.<br />
<br />
Sza Sza has court this Friday, 9/11 and we are determined to assist in getting her out of detention and towards safety.]]></content:encoded>

Though an appeal to the state Supreme Court is in the works, this means that potentially for most of this winter, the criminal punishment system will deny our unhoused neighb...ors the basic human right to not only safe, affordable housing but to camp undisturbed without having their homes and property "swept" and stolen/trashed under the orders of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverdoti/">Denver Department of Transportation and Infrastructure</a> or the Denver Department of Public Health and Environment. (Let's be real, though - we know you're behind these orders, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/5280mayor/">Michael B. Hancock</a>).</p><p> A recent study by the municipal public defender's office found that 30% of the people caught in the revolving door of the municipal court system are Black (Denver is 10% Black), and that 38% of total municipal court cases involve unhoused people charged with minor, nonviolent violations directly related to homelessness.</p><p> Racial justice is intersectional justice - please continue to support organizations like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/coloradodashr/">Denver Alliance for Street Health Response</a> who work with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/">Denver Homeless Out Loud</a> to ensure that our unhoused neighbors have what they need to survive this winter. <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/supporting-dashr039s-community-response">https://www.gofundme.com/f/supporting-dashr039s-community-r…</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SURJDenver/posts/2692175781056578">See More</a><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/supporting-dashr039s-community-response">Denver Alliance for Street Health Response (DASHR) is an organization focused o… Vinnie Cervantes needs your support for Supporting DASHR's Community Response<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDTNoUoaYJwrWBv&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net%2F48934810_1592509035270542_r.jpeg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQAuCSMb-QBmBKDq" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>gofundme.com</p><p>Supporting DASHR's Community Response, organized by Vinnie Cervantes</p>Denver Alliance for Street Health Response (DASHR) is an organization focused o… Vinnie Cervantes needs your support for Supporting DASHR's Community Response<a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/supporting-dashr039s-community-response">Denver Alliance for Street Health Response (DASHR) is an organization focused o… Vinnie Cervantes needs your support for Supporting DASHR's Community Response</a>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>One of the good things about the fenced in park is that it keeps police resources, usually 6-8 officers and a couple vehicles, out of the rest of Denver. </p> <p>There are no officers or vehicles currently inside the fence (as of about 9 PM), likely due to the weather. I imagine that any quickly organized demonstrations at the fence during this quick cold snap could be interesting.</p> <p>If they insist on keeping the fence up then we can at least make them dedicate the resources to guarding it 24/7, and if the displaced homeless have to be in the cold and the wet then it&#39;s only fair that a few officers join in.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HolidayInn-Cambodia"> /u/HolidayInn-Cambodia </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ip89xe/minimal_police_presence_at_the_former_capitol/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ip89xe/minimal_police_presence_at_the_former_capitol/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

The City appealed it to the Denver District Court where Judge Eric Elliff just ruled the opposite - ruling the ban is constitutional. This Judge’s ruling is factually wrong. This fight for justice and humanity will continue to a hig...her court as we continue to struggle to survive without housing while being chased around and ticketed by cops following an unconstitutional law. </p><p> Courts around the nation have found camping ban laws unconstitutional noting them as cruel and unusual punishment.  More importantly, people living without housing find these laws to be cruel and unusual punishment. How laws that make it illegal to cover yourself with a blanket in freezing weather are NOT considered cruel is beyond understanding. This latest Judge's ruling depends entirely on the idea that shelters are viable, available places to PUT people. It is time we ask...what really is the difference between being told to go to a shelter and being told to go to jail?? (If you have stayed in shelters you will understand the question).</p><p> After halting enforcement of the camping ban at the start of the COVID crisis, the Mayor has now directed police to engage camping ban enforcement as of August 7th 2020 - this direction is in opposition of CDC guidance concerning encampments during covid. The practice of chasing people from one block to another without housing them is not only cruel, it is ineffective. To continue this Ineffective practice makes no sense. People living on the streets have no other options and as a result are living in constant fear and instability as police descend on camps running people’s names, arresting anyone with old warrants no matter how petty, forcing people to pack up and move at any hour of the day or night. </p><p> This human rights struggle is not over. As long as people are living without housing, told their survival is a crime, the fight on the streets, in the legislature, and in the courts will continue.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/1986390991490844">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/photos/a.271630356300258/1986390938157516/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p235x350/119127749_1986390941490849_1761979461739941517_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=jHYv3BBIhKkAX-deXg3&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=09119f2d85b809d7c6caaecc6163e707&oe=5F83C3C5" alt="Image may contain: 2 people, people standing, beard and outdoor" width="500" height="334" caption="Image may contain: 2 people, people standing, beard and outdoor" /></a>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>I&#39;m trying to find reputable mutual aid orgs, as well as communist/socialist orgs in the Denver area. I know DSA is pretty big here but I&#39;m not totally on board with them. PSL has a solid presence at the protests, and I recently reached out to one of their organizers. Do y&#39;all know of any other orgs I could get involved with around here?

Not only is it environmentally wasteful and costly to taxpayers, but it condemns folks on the street to suffering and possibly death.

Denver will go from sweltering heat with a high of 93 degrees on Monday to 34 degrees and snowing on Tuesday. This is why, with unpredicta...ble weather changes like this, taking survival gear from unhoused folks and trashing it is dehumanizing violence. Not only is it environmentally wasteful and costly to taxpayers, but it condemns folks on the street to suffering and possibly death. Folks can’t take their tents and sleeping bags into shelters either, and surely in the middle of a global pandemic, we might understand why folks would rather be outside than crammed in shelters. </p><p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/">Denver Homeless Out Loud</a> is collecting sleeping bags, tents, tarps, and other survival gear at 2260 California until 5pm today and will distribute to folks in the area (contact info&#064;denverhomelessoutloud.org for questions). DASHR will be supporting folks in the Cap Hill area tomorrow by handing out hand warmers, socks, and supporting unhoused folks with our street medics. We will also be coordinating with the STAR van for crises that are beyond our street team. Contact us to get involved or to find ways to support these efforts at dashrorg&#064;gmail.com or by messaging this page.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

We'd like to echo that call - let’s flood their registration process or let them know directly why trainings like this are dangerous and problematic and should be called off by emailing christie.mochoruk&#064;denvergov.org.</p><p> Why is this training a bad thing?</p>...<p> A department that has demonstrated again and again that it has no respect for the lives of our BIPOC neighbors, people experiencing homelessness, or protesters has no business teaching the community how to protect itself.</p><p> There is no way the racism baked into policing cannot replicate itself in how they teach neighbors to spy on each other (they can’t even keep it out of their logo - a menacing, featureless image of a "suspicious" black man).</p><p> The “intruder” mentality built by Neighborhood Watch programs, when combined with racial bias, results in vigilante murders like that of Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery.</p><p> Neighborhood Watch teaches communities to fear each other, to watch for “outsiders”, to surveil each other, and to rely on the threat of police violence to feel “safe”. True safety comes from communication, empathy, and mutual aid. Cops don't keep us safe, we keep us safe.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SURJDenver/posts/2689577174649772">See More</a><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EhBwXwUXcAYHvc_.jpg"><img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDzV7DarhpZkQtk&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fmedia%2FEhBwXwUXcAYHvc_.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQBWS0GyfyLR-yrj" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>pbs.twimg.com</p><p>pbs.twimg.com</p><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EhBwXwUXcAYHvc_.jpg"></a>]]></content:encoded>

HAPPENING NOW: Your mayor and council members are meeting to discuss the 2-year contract with #DenverPoliceDepartment that increases their budget in the second year. This budget increase allows for MORE funds devoted to the chemical weapons they terrorize our city with!  They plan to quietly vote on it tomorrow 9/3 with only online public comment that they can control the narrative on with the click of a button. Contact your council member and Michael B. Hancock TODAY and let them know as their constituent you DEMAND they do not support the following:<br />
<br />
❌Any Collective Bargaining Agreement with DPD longer than 1 year. <br />
<br />
❌Any agreement that gives ANY financial increases or incentives to police. <br />
<br />
❌Any agreement that does not require police to be financially responsible for their attorneys and settlements in any cases of alleged excessive force or race related discrimination<br />

As unemployment and COVID-19 cases continue to rise, women have shown that they are not only essential workers but are essential to revolution!

They are not sweet or cuddly. Denver police murdered William Debose, Paul Childs, Dion Damon, Michael Marshall, Jason Gomez, J...esse Hernandez, Marvin Booker, Paul Castaway, Ryan Ronquillo, Joseph Valverde, Odiceo Valencia-Lopez, Naeschylus Carter-Vinzant, and many more. They have brutalized countless members of our community and put many more behind bars.

It has put a great deal of us at-risk adult in harms way. For me, this can be a potential death sentence. At my age and with underlying health conditions, this feels like cruel and unusual punishment.”</p><p> — Anthony Martinez...</p><p> Anthony Martinez is an 84-year-old grandfather suffering from renal failure, as well as other serious medical conditions including dementia. He is currently incarcerated in the Sterling Correctional Facility, site of one of Colorado’s largest COVID-19 outbreaks with almost 600 active COVID-19 cases. He and his family are understandably terrified that he will catch the virus and die.</p><p> Anthony has spent over 30 years behind bars for a series of robberies. He has paid a substantial debt to society for these crimes. With his age and infirmity, no one can argue he is a public safety risk, but he has a substantial risk of becoming seriously ill or dying from COVID-19 if he remains incarcerated. Despite this, his special needs parole application was denied.</p><p> Anthony’s niece, Kelly, has a room in her home waiting for him to spend his final years. She says, “Only nine people on the side of the prison where my uncle is currently held are still negative for COVID-19. It’s all around him and it’s only a matter of time before he gets sick. I know my uncle is lonely and isolated. He uses a wheelchair, is hard of hearing and is locked in his cell almost all day. Prison is no place for elderly people. Please, I need my uncle home before he dies.”</p><p> In the midst of this public health crisis, incarcerated people as vulnerable as Anthony, could and should be immediately released to safely live out their remaining years with family.   <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/decarcerationday">#decarcerationday</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/freethemall">#FreeThemAll</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/covidjustice">#covidjustice</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/carenotcages">#carenotcages</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/endmassincarceration">#endmassincarceration</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/covidcolorado">#COVIDcolorado</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/doyourpart">#doyourpart</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/bringourneighborshome">#bringourneighborshome</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/redemptionisreal">#redemptionisreal</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/clemencyiscompassion">#clemencyiscompassion</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/106087521153591/photos/a.107461271016216/146190013810008/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/118510541_146190017143341_7052916449486077761_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=olGWREk-6ikAX_vPrC1&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&oh=bf1db46c2c61aadebec1e439b0257b6c&oe=5F83CCB8" alt="Image may contain: 4 people, people standing and hat, text that says 'ACLU co NO ONE DESERVES &#x3c4;&#x3bf; DIE FROM COVID-19 MARTINEZ ANTHONY ANTHONY'S FAMILY IS READY &#x3a4;&#x3bf; WELCOME HIM HOME.'" width="500" height="500" caption="Image may contain: 4 people, people standing and hat, text that says 'ACLU co NO ONE DESERVES &#x3c4;&#x3bf; DIE FROM COVID-19 MARTINEZ ANTHONY ANTHONY'S FAMILY IS READY &#x3a4;&#x3bf; WELCOME HIM HOME.'" /></a>]]></content:encoded>

His age and respiratory ailments put him at risk of serious illness and death if he contracts COVID-19. With over hundreds of active cases in Colorado’s prisons, his family fears he will not make it out alive. His daughter, Amber, says, “In prison, he can’t protect himself and he can’t social distance. My deep fear is that my dad will die in prison. That is a...n awful, traumatic reality to consider. My chest is tight just thinking about how quickly it spreads and how vulnerable he is.” </p><p> Governor Hickenlooper shortened his sentence following testimony from family, friends and correctional officers advocating for his early release. Yet, he is still eight years away from parole. While he remains in prison, COVID-19 continues to spread. Ronald’s three siblings, four children and four grandchildren are desperate for his release.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/acluofcolorado/posts/3499408936759237">See More</a><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/118464736_1057883024670238_5027461490615456778_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&_nc_sid=f2c4d5&_nc_ohc=0n0dcbIZRL4AX8jWAjH&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&oh=182ccdca6b27356599fe997efdd645a6&oe=5F84AFF8" />]]></content:encoded>

Still, we must never normalize watching and reading about any violence enacted on our friends and loved ones, pieces of ourselves, on the internet. We give thanks to the ancestors and higher power that guided #JacobBlake back to share more joyful moments with his children like the one in this picture we are intentionally sharing instead of that horrific video. Today we are reminded that it is an essential component of #Blackliberation to take pause and hold space for our whole selves &mdash;body, mind, and spirit. To choose healing. #Blackhealingisrevolutionary #BlackLivesMatter]]></content:encoded>

I’m not talking about it’s close cousin white guilt. Penitenti...al whiteness differs from white guilt in that it is vocal. It’s more than a feeling...it falls over itself to outperform and out woke every other white “ally.” </p><p> Penitential whiteness might look and sound desirable, but I can guarantee you that it absolutely is not. It is exhausting. </p><p> Penitential whiteness is a paradox. </p><p> It demands labor by performing labor. Instead of lending quiet support behind the scenes, it is loud and in front. It needs the cookies and badges from Black people. If no cookies are given, there is an assumption that something went wrong, and so the penitential white person become insecure and needs to make sure they’re still a “good person.” </p><p> It centers itself by de-centering whiteness. Penitential whiteness makes sure that everyone knows that they are not in the center by telling everyone that they aren’t in the center. They are in the center of all of the fe-centering. </p><p> Penitential whiteness does everything at full steam. If it’s calling out other white folks penitent white folks will be the loudest and most persistent. If it is if it’s raising awareness, you can expect a full, scripted pitch. If it is showing up, it will be the first one there and the last to leave. </p><p> Penitential whiteness, on the surface, might seem like a healthy expression of allyship (or whatever y’all calling it right now). The difference between being a healthy co-conspirator and a penitential white individual is about posture. Penitential white folks can do good work, but that good work is rooted in relieving the pressure to prove their goodness rather than in the liberation of others. </p><p> Beware and be wary of penitential whiteness. It’s not a good look. At the end of the day, penitential whiteness does more harm than good because the “work” of a penitential person of whiteness is rooted in their zeal to prove themselves. </p><p> Penitential whiteness does not combat white supremacy, it reinforces it by—once again—making people of whiteness the hero of their own narratives. The narrative, in this case, is being The Best Ally That Ever Allied and sucking all of the air (and liberation) out of the room. </p><p> I don’t expect everyone to understand or agree with this word. But I hope that it will at least get folks thinking about how they approach the work of antiracism.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

Last Wednesday, when 40+ DPD officers brutalized community members assisting unhoused neighbors with sweeps, we drew a line in the sand. Enough is enough!</p><p> We demand justice for our unhoused neighbors, as well as the families of William Debose, Alexis Mendez-Perez, Paul Castaway, Michael Marshall, Marvin Booker, Ryan Ronquillo, Jessie Hernandez and the thousands of people in our city impacted by state-backed violence. The Denver City Council has failed to hear our calls for justice, liberation and abolition. We know that human rights only come alive when citizens organize, protest, boycott, rebel and violate the law in order to uphold justice!</p><p> Twelve comrades were arrested last night. Some were released on PR bond but we still have 3 bonds of $500 each to pay and two comrades with bond not allowed until court on Monday afternoon. Please help raise the ransom for these brave rebels and get them out of cages with an active COVID outbreak! Let's get our comrades back to their loved ones, their pets and their jobs tonight!</p><p> As the election approaches, we are looking to make an active bail fund for rebels. Any excess monies will be put into this revolving fund as we work to create it!

The program provides a more appropriate and more humane approach to crisis involving homelessness, mental health, and substance use. The CAHOOTS program answers about one-fifth of the 911 calls in Eugene and saves the city on average $8 million per year. DASHR’s efforts, alongside other community groups and partners, resulted in the launch of the new STAR (Support Team Assisted Response) pilot program in Denver on June 1st. </p><p> Since January, DASHR has also been working with members of Aurora’s City Council to explore building a model similar to CAHOOTS. “Aurora currently has a co-responder model, but we know that a police presence can escalate a situation,“ said Councilwoman Allison Hiltz who chairs the public safety committee on council. “In looking at other models, we are better able to prioritize our community’s needs and rethink how we deliver mental health care.” She plans to present a brief update on their progress at a committee meeting on August 27, with hopes for a more complete proposal in the near future. </p><p> Natalia Marshall, whose uncle Michael Marshall was killed in the Denver jail noted that this type of response could prevent similar things from happening. “My uncle Michael had schizophrenia and when he called police to report his bible as stolen, he was met by police officers instead of mental health professionals who brought him to the jail, which led to his death.” She adds that he needed mental health services not jail. Natalia is an Aurora resident and activist for alternatives to police and criminal justice reform.</p><p> DASHR strongly believes in creating alternatives to policing, jail, and the prison industrial complex more generally. “I believe we’re in a critical moment where the ideas we’ve been fighting to achieve for years are finally getting the attention and consideration they’ve always deserved,” said Vinnie Cervantes, Organizing Director of DASHR. “It’s important that our solutions are truly alternatives to systemic harm and that they are led by the community” DASHR is committed to helping facilitate community involvement in the programs.</p><p> About DASHR<br /> Denver Alliance for Street Health Response (DASHR) is a coalition of groups and individuals who create and support community- based responses to crisis and conflict, as well as forge new narratives of public health and safety.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
Many of us in the Coalition to Close the Concentation Camps knew that it was time to take action against forces of fascism and evil- especially for our families impacted by this broken immigration system.  On July 12, 2019, radicals and impacted families split from the milquetoast Lights for Liberty vigil being conducted at the Aurora ICE Processing Center. Rebels marched  into the parking lot of GEO- where anticolonial speeches were given by indigenous youth and where the now infamous flag removal occurred. <br />
<br />
Following the flag removal and international embarrassment, the Aurora Police Department began a Twitter manhunt offering a $4k reward to identify suspects from that evening; violent crimes typically only get a $1k reward and we knew this outrageously large reward was made because two anti police flags were flown that night. Cowards at APD wouldn't fire or prosecute the murderers of Elijah McClain the following month, yet APD had the time and resources to target non-violent protestors demanding justice for immigrants.<br />
<br />
The woman featured in this powerful photo, Michelle, was eventually identified by non profit &quot;allies&quot; and served misdemeanor tampering charges; Michelle's case with Aurora dragged on for over a year. Today we have some good news: our hero was found NOT GUILTY by jury trial and walks free of all charges! Fuck APD!<br />
<br />
Michelle- you are an inspiration and a true Chingona. With you, our city sent a message to the Department of Homeland Security.  Your bravery, in addition to the life Willem Van Spronsen gave on July 13th 2019 by setting ICE's kidnapping vans in Tacoma ablaze, made ICE retreat on their planned nationwide mass arrests of immigrants.<br />

Black August, first commemorated by our incarcerated brothers and sisters, is a time to recommit ourselves to the struggle for #BlackLiberation and to honor those who&rsquo;ve contributed to our collective progress and all those who have been lost to unjust violence and systemic racism.<br />
This August 21, join us in a car protest to bring the Black August fight to our local prison walls. We will drive in a mobile protest to the Denver County Jail and the GEO Aurora ICE detention facility to let those who are chained there know that we are with them, we are fighting for them, and we will keep fighting until all chains are broken.<br />
The many injustices faced by those behind bars in the U.S. are today amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Prisons and jails all across the country, where medical neglect is commonplace and quarantining impossible, have become hotspots of infection. Hundreds have died in US prisons from COVID-19, and yet no response has been made to defend against unnecessary death. The mass incarceration of Black, Brown, and Indigenous populations means that they are not only disproportionately affected by the virus outside of jail, but inside as well.<br />
We raise the following demands, recognizing that if they are not met, more unnecessary death is a certainty:<br />
1. Immediate humanitarian release of all ICE detainees and all vulnerable inmates, those convicted for non-violent offenses, and those who have not been convicted at all.<br />
2. Where people remain behind bars, drastically increase medical staffing and supplies to local jails and state prisons, and guarantee sanitary conditions for all inmates.<br />
3. Free all political prisoners!<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CD4JIkZl_ge/" target="_blank"><img src="https://instagram.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/e35/117796655_1457230414478585_3109650300336961132_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net&amp;_nc_cat=105&amp;_nc_ohc=ez2bUVR8ZhMAX8M5xfH&amp;oh=7ce96600af329cead13a4cfce048864a&amp;oe=5F88AFF7" alt=""All we are asking is to be transferred back to the Aurora facility. We are not asking for a release. They have the..." /></a><br><br>&quot;All we are asking is to be transferred back to the Aurora facility. We are not asking for a release. They have the authority to transfer us immediately if we want,&quot; says Jimmy Sodhi, a 45-year-old ICE detainee.<br />
<br />
Sodhi is part of a group of eight ICE detainees who have been housed in the same dormitory at the Teller County Jail since being transferred there from the Aurora Contract Detention Facility one month ago. Sodhi and the other ICE detainees began the hunger strike on the morning of August 10 to protest what they allege are significantly worse conditions at Aurora GEO.<br />
<br />
&quot;As a Sikh, I'm not allowed to wear my Sikh bracelet, I'm not allowed to cover my head. If I have to pray, it's required for me to cover my head. I'm told to cover my head with a pillowcase or a towel,&quot; says Sodhi, who has been in ICE custody since March 2017 and is currently in the appeals process of his deportation case stemming from a fraud conviction for insider trading. &quot;That is very demeaning, very disrespectful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sodhi notes that he was allowed to wear his turban at the Aurora detention facility, but has been told by staff at the Teller County Jail that he cannot retrieve his turban from his personal belongings. Same with prayer books, Sodhi adds, which he hasn't been able to obtain, being told by staff that &quot;there's no chaplain here and we don't have those here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Additionally, Sodhi contends that he and other ICE detainees at the Teller County Jail have been subjected to racial harassment perpetrated by non-ICE detainees staying in the same dormitory.<br />
<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
Adding to his angst, Sodhi contends that he and the other detainees don't even know why they're being housed in the Teller County Jail, which has an agreement with ICE to house immigrant detainees.<br />

(Hint: we think it should include abolishing the police.) <br /> We share many others' skepticism about task forces like these, but we know and respect many of the conveners of this forum..., we believe in community engagement even when skepticism is warranted, and as the saying goes, "if you're not at the table, you're probably on the menu." So we hope to see many people attending with a critical eye and an open mind.

Por que la comunidad Negra está marchando y protestando en estos momentos? Porque la policía sigue matando a la gente Negra. Porque la patrulla fronteriza está matando a nuestra gente en la frontera entonces mi llamado ahorita en nuestra comunidad es pensar más allá de nosotros, hacer todas las conecciones, tomar las calles, organizarnos para que toda esta violencia puede terminar. Y ustedes como Univisión tienen responsabilidad de contar toda la historia de todo lo que esta pasando así como hablamos de las deportaciones ustedes también tienen que hablar por que la gente sigue muriendo en manos de la policía, particularmente la gente Negra. Ese es mi llamado. En este momento hacer negocio con esta administración es una traición a la comunidad Negra y a las familias que siguen muriendo."</p><p> ******<br /> Sign the petition to demand Univisión and Telemundo stop their antiBlack coverage:  <a href="https://bit.ly/lasvidasnegrasimportan">bit.ly/lasvidasnegrasimportan</a>  </p><p> "I understand that there is going to be a lot of pain right now for our community but we also have a responsibility to make connections between everything that is happening. Why is the Black community marching and protesting right now? Because the police are still killing Black people. Because border patrol is killing our people. So my call to action right now in our community is to think beyond us, make these connections, take to the streets, and organize so that all this violence can end. And you as Univision have a responsibility to tell the whole story of everything that is happening, just like how we talk about deportations, you also have to talk about why people keep dying at the hands of the police, particularly Black people. That is my call to action. Right now doing business with this administration is a betrayal of the Black community and the families that continue to die.

We see this new community-driven service as a form of preventative medicine for police violence. If it had been in place long ...ago, could have prevented the deaths of Elijah McClain, Michael Marshall, Paul Castaway, Paul Childs, and countless other victims of police violence in Denver. <br /> Abolition is not a metaphor - it's a tangible possibility, and this is an important example of how our communities can start to build the alternatives to modern policing that we need to keep our communities safe. We can have a world without police. We can have a world without prisons. And we are already on our way to building it.<br /> Read more about the STAR program in our joint press release with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/">Denver Homeless Out Loud</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/coloradodashr/">Denver Alliance for Street Health Response</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/harmreductionactioncenter/">Harm Reduction Action Center</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RecoveringDenver/">Mental Health Center of Denver</a>here: <a href="http://www.denverjusticeproject.org/2020/06/08/press-release-alternative-public-health-emergency-response-pilot-launches-in-denver">www.denverjusticeproject.org/…/press-release-alternative-pu…</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverJusticeProject/posts/3110110802376621">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverJusticeProject/photos/a.900402720014118/3110107502376951/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/103066453_3110107505710284_8653334129786094722_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=EkoCu-oo6JgAX85jsbu&_nc_oc=AQnW9_VzcX7cuXP5dTcBDyOZ_yxOh1ZyNhsimVs0pY2r0B3KlFQZdmvk9QasvmahjCA&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&oh=38d70df6d45002830821341f4fb758db&oe=5F854C3A" alt="Image may contain: text that says 'YOU ARE EXPERIENCING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS & AFRAID IMAGINE...
