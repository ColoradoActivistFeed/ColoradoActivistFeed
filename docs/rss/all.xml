Justice for Elijah McClain!</a> (Facebook event)</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> PSL </p> <p><em>Location:</em> Colorado State Capitol </p> <p><em>Host-provided information:</em> On June 25, under the pressure of mass protests against racist police killings, Governor Jared Polis issued an executive order which would open an independent investigation into Elijah McClain’s death, led by state Attorney General Phil Weiser. This was after Aurora District Attorney Dave Young declined to file any charges against the killers, then the city of Aurora opened a sham investigation led by a former cop which was terminated because it was plainly not “independent”. Now it is up to Phil Weiser to decide whether the cops and paramedics responsible for Elijah’s death will face any criminal charges. </p> <p>But just this week, Governor Polis quietly loosened the scope of the investigation, allowing Weiser to investigate for “offenses”, not just “criminal activity” related to Elijah’s death, opening up the possibility for him to come back with watered down charges against the killers, like we saw in Breonna Taylor’s case. Polis also took out the words that suggest someone caused the death of Elijah McClain. </p> <p>Polis must think that the movement isn’t paying attention, that we’ve been subdued by the repressive arrests of movement leaders, and now he can reel back his investigation without opposition in the streets. He is wrong. Join us for an emergency action to make it clear that we are still here and we are not going anywhere until we get justice for Elijah McClain! MASKS REQUIRED (OVER YOUR NOSE &amp; MOUTH!) &amp; PLEASE KEEP DISTANCE BETWEEN YOURSELF AND OTHERS.&quot; </p> <p><em>Type of Event:</em> Protest/Rally</p> </blockquote> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/denverprotestsdaily"> /u/denverprotestsdaily </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/jv18c3/whats_happening_the_week_of_november_16_22/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/jv18c3/whats_happening_the_week_of_november_16_22/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The purpose of GA</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/juydl2/the_purpose_of_ga/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I just wanted to say a few things about the GA that happened today that may be a bit controversial, but I have the best intentions so please hear me out. The biggest issue I have is that we spent over and hour and a half criticizing our fellow protestors. Is that the intention of GA? I understand that many people are against property destruction as a form of protest. This includes Trump supporters, instagram liberals, and apparently some of our own as well. I also understand that some people prefer we not be agitators. But at the same time should we really be telling other protestors what to do? Isn&#39;t trying to stop them mean suppressing their freedom of speech, just like the police do to us at every protest (peaceful or not)? I guess I never know what to expect from GA, but it was just tough to sit through a hour and a half of my allies ripping through my other allies (and really behind their back in a way). Ultimately I want more people showing up to protests and I feel like all this &quot;peace policing&quot; is doing the opposite. Again, is that the intention of GA?</p> <p>My solution? I think GA&#39;s should be almost entirely about future actions and actually ENCOURAGING people to come out. Even if its instagram liberals, it still gives us greater numbers, and ultimately those half-ass protestors will be affected by our leaders narratives. If you disagree with that idea, do you want people who are more &quot;intense&quot; to organize separately then? Again just trying to have an honest discussion. Is it crazy to think we should have a more positive energy when it comes to dealing with people who actually agree with us at the end of the day?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SwimPhillips"> /u/SwimPhillips </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/juydl2/the_purpose_of_ga/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/juydl2/the_purpose_of_ga/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

Our core values demand we take personal responsibility for denouncing the kind of discrimination, harassment, and racism Mrs. Kastman has experienced in Boulder County. Further, we believe the District Attorney has a responsibility to the public to reexamine her case through an unbiased lens. We believe that acknowledgment and reconsideration of the implicit biases in this case should lead to the conclusion that the interests of justice require that Mrs. Kastman's case be dismissed.<br /> Mrs. Kastman moved to Colorado just a couple of years ago having never experienced the kind of blatant racism she would encounter from her neighbors here. Through constant harassment of herself and her children, having the police called on her family for just being outside their home, and incessant racial slurs repeatedly directed at them no protective measures by law enforcement were ever taken on the Kastman family’s behalf. In fact, on one occasion Mrs. Kastman’s husband, for attempting to stand up to the neighbors' persecution, was charged with harassment. Unsurprisingly, Mrs. Kastman's husband, a white man, received a deferred prosecution agreement on the harassment charge, a privilege that has not been extended to Mrs. Kastman.<br /> Mrs. Kastman, fed up with her family being subjected to targeted harassment indirectly responded to this discrimination out of frustration. The neighbors again reported her, and she was charged with a Class 3 Felony for Witness Retaliation, which carries anywhere from 4 - 12 years in prison followed by 5 years of parole. Jeweldine does not have a criminal history. Despite her lack of criminal history, the Longmont Police Department bypassed the opportunity to issue a summons to Mrs. Kastman and instead chose to arrest Mrs. Kastman in front of her children.<br /> The DA of Boulder County, Michael Dougherty, is only willing to reduce the charges if Mrs. Kastman pleads guilty to harassment or disorderly conduct. The white men who have habitually berated and antagonized this family in front of their home have never been charged. After years of living in constant fear, and after her husband was charged with harassment for standing up to racists threatening their family, Jeweldine Kastman is being ordered to sacrifice her freedom or plead guilty to a crime she did not commit. In September of 2019, DA Michael Dougherty’s office announced their commitment to prosecute instances of bias and hate motivated crimes “to the full extent of the law.” How is it that just one year later we’re being called to action against an obvious display of bias and hate in Boulder County that is being enabled by the DA himself? We do not stand for this. We stand firmly in support of Mrs. Jeweldine Kastman and her family, and we demand a full dismissal of this case and that the harassment conviction her husband received for verbally defending his family be overturned immediately. We demand that DA Michael Dougherty honor his commitment to the people of Boulder County and interrupt this perpetual cycle of bias in our justice department. This family had law enforcement sworn to serve and protect them weaponized against them at a time<br /> when they feared for their lives. We demand justice.

      <title>City of Aurora files public court denial of wrongdoing in Elijah McClain case</title>

      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><a href="https://kdvr.com/news/local/city-of-aurora-files-public-court-denial-of-wrongdoing-in-elijah-mcclain-case/">https://kdvr.com/news/local/city-of-aurora-files-public-court-denial-of-wrongdoing-in-elijah-mcclain-case/</a> </p> <p>AURORA, Colo. (KDVR) — Attorneys for the City of Aurora filed recent court paperwork denying responsibility for the death of Elijah McClain.</p> <p>“The death of Elijah McClain is a tragedy; however, this tragedy was not caused by any acts or omissions of the (Aurora Police Department) Defendants. APD Defendants deny that they used excessive force on Mr. McClain in violation of the Fourth Amendment, that they denied him equal protection of the law under the Fourteenth Amendment and that they caused his death by batter or neglect,” a filing in federal court said.</p> <p>The scheduling order, filed in late October, also claimed officers were “justified” in stopping McClain as he was walking home and in their use of the carotid hold, a subduing technique that is now banned by the City of Aurora. </p> <p>It also denies wrongdoing on behalf of the Aurora Fire Rescue paramedics who sedated McClain with ketamine before he died.</p> <p>A coroner who ruled McClain’s death to be undetermined said his rough interaction with police and the ketamine administration could not be ruled out as contributors to his death.</p> <p>The Aurora Fire defendants “deny any negligent, intentionally tortious, or otherwise unlawful conduct in connection with their treatment of Plaintiff McClain on August 24, 2019. At all times relevant to the allegations…all actions by defendants…were conducted in good faith and with the believe that their actions were lawful, reasonable, and consistent with their duties and obligations as firefighter paramedics for the City of Aurora under local, state, and federal law and regulations,” the filing stated.</p> <p>The City also argued that some defendants could be entitled to use the defense of qualified immunity, that they were unaware that their actions may have been a violation of a plaintiff’s rights.</p> <p>“All of them murdered an innocent young man, and yet, they say, ‘It’s a tragedy,’ but none of them were responsible for it. Well, that’s a lot of BS,” said Mari Newman, the attorney who represents McClain’s family.</p> <p>Newman laid out her arguments in the same filing, as well as estimates for the amount of financial damages she hopes to seek on behalf of the McClain family. The medical costs totaled close to $250,000, and she estimated the losses of McClain’s future earnings could be as high as $3.5 million.</p> <p>“These calculable damages are the tip of the iceberg,” said Newman, explaining that there are likely tens of millions of dollars in other damages she hopes to collect for his family’s emotional losses and the experience McClain endured during the incident.</p> <p>“The biggest thing, I think, is the emotional pain and suffering that Elijah went through as this 18 minutes of torture unfolded. It’s not like it was just sort of a quick and painless death. It was a prolonged and petrifying experience where he knew he was going to die, and he was begging for his life,” she said.</p> <p>Newman also said she would be seeking punitive damages.</p> <p>“We recognize the tragic nature of the death of Elijah McClain. However, the city disagrees with the broad characterizations expressed in the lawsuit, including some that are completely unrelated to the facts of this case,” said Michael Bryant, a spokesperson for the City of Aurora. “The statements in the scheduling order, which is a required filing in all federal cases, are based on a legal view of this matter relying on applicable laws and court decisions. A critical review of our organization is underway and we have made, and will continue to make, changes to how Police serve all people in our city that are responsive to what the community wants and deserves. Because of the ongoing litigation, we are unable to provide further information about the city’s legal actions in this case.”</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kellypell"> /u/kellypell </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/jtyolv/city_of_aurora_files_public_court_denial_of/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/jtyolv/city_of_aurora_files_public_court_denial_of/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

This was after Aurora District Attorney Dave Young declined to file any charges against the killers, then the city of Aurora opened a sham investigation led by a former cop which was terminated because it was plainly not “independent”.... Now it is up to Phil Weiser to decide whether the cops and paramedics responsible for Elijah’s death will face any criminal charges.</p><p> But just this week, Governor Polis quietly loosened the scope of the investigation, allowing Weiser to investigate for “offenses”, not just “criminal activity” related to Elijah’s death, opening up the possibility for him to come back with watered down charges against the killers, like we saw in Breonna Taylor’s case. Polis also took out the words that suggest someone caused the death of Elijah McClain.</p><p> Polis must think that the movement isn’t paying attention, that we’ve been subdued by the repressive arrests of movement leaders, and now he can reel back his investigation without opposition in the streets. He is wrong.</p><p> Join us for an emergency action to make it clear that we are still here and we are not going anywhere until we get justice for Elijah McClain!</p><p> MASKS REQUIRED (OVER YOUR NOSE & MOUTH!) & PLEASE KEEP DISTANCE BETWEEN YOURSELF AND OTHERS.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AbolishICEDenver/posts/725862328023347">See More</a><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s526x296/125278763_1081285375657285_3437983229966432355_o.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=2&_nc_sid=b386c4&_nc_ohc=3aq3IdxDgSsAX9vVXzw&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=7&oh=401d611ded7c556cd17af7c5d5abd980&oe=5FD69D6B" alt="Party for Socialism and Liberation - Denver's photo." width="504" height="263" caption="Party for Socialism and Liberation - Denver's photo." /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2411035489021262/"></a><p>SAT, NOV 21 AT 1:00 PM MST</p><p>EMERGENCY ACTION: Eyes on Weiser!

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I often put the television on. I live alone, for the most part, with my cat. My kids drop by when they can. I have turned into an empty nester. The pandemic has left me without employment since March. You could say I am going a little stir crazy. There is one thing I have always valued. My education. There was a time, in the world, that an educated woman would not be welcomed. Tonight I watched Saving Capitalism on Netflix. I was highly suspicion because capitalism has screwed me over. With the heels of the election fresh on everyone&#39;s mind this is a beautiful reminder. It is time to put politics aside. Robert Reich is probably shorter than me- and I am short at 5’3”. He explains economics in a way that is more palatable that most econ professors. It is dull. For years middle class Americans have been hurting. I am one of them. I am sure if you are reading this you are too. I am not some crazy ultra liberal or conservative. Like most people in America, I lay somewhere in the middle. It is time for change on many levels. The biggest one that will have the biggest impact is corporate America. Subsidies is a term for corporate America. It is taxpayers money going to corporate America. When a corporation needs help they will ally for a grant or a loan. It will create job growth and industry stabilization. Google it. Go ahead. Take the time. It is corporate welfare. When it comes to corporations the time has come for America to shun them. Corporate America is ruining America. They can now buy politicians. This includes pharmaceuticals. It is time to redefine America. It will personally be hard for me because I love some of the biggest things about corporate America. But supporting small businesses will not only help me ween off corporate America. It will help my community. Ethics is something that has been buried deep and it is time to find them again. Stop and think about who you work for. If we all walk away from these giants they will have no more minions. Seriously. Think about it. How many CEOs get payouts at the end of the year for performance? Too many. Corporations are the reason you do not have a voice. There had been a study about it. Stop blaming politicians. Without corporations they would be nothing. I have two challenges for every American. First challenge: Demand that politicians stop taking corporate donations. In fact, it is time to hold them accountable to who keeps them in office. Demand that they have clear, readily accessible, list of donors. If they do not- they DO NOT DESERVE your vote. No debate. Second challenge: Create a boycott within your community! Find one corporation that you can purge from your life and share it. More if possible. It is time to send them a message. You can pay people reasonable living wages, if shareholders, executives, and others get reasonable salaries. The time for wealth hoarding has come to an end. Remember Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party? They wanted the same thing. Corporate America to be held accountable. These 2 simple steps we show American it is time for change. Change starts with you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/alaskagirl_amm"> /u/alaskagirl_amm </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/jt8qas/time_to_start_a_movement/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/jt8qas/time_to_start_a_movement/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

I joined the Army and went for basic training on my eighteenth birthday in June of 2001. I was assigned to the 10t...h Mountain Division and in March of 2003 I was attached to the 173rd Airborne Brigade deployed to norther Iraq. </p><p> Um, so when I first joined the Army, we were told that racism no longer existed in the military. A legacy of inequality and discrimination was suddenly washed away by something called the ‘Equal Opportunity Program. We would sit through mandatory classes and every unit had this EO representative to ensure that no elements of racism could resurface. The Army seemed firmly dedicated to smashing any hint of racism. And then September 11th happened and I began to hear new words like ‘towel head’ and ‘camel jockey’ and the most disturbing: ‘sand nigger.’ And these words did not initially come from my fellow soldiers but from my superiors: my platoon sergeant, my company first sergeant, battalion commander. All the way up the chain of command these terms, these viciously racist terms were suddenly acceptable.</p><p> And I noticed that the most overt racism came from veterans of the first Gulf War. And those were the words they used when incenerating civilian convoys. Those were the words they used when this government delivered any target(ing) of civilian infrastructure; bombing water supplies knowing it would kill hundreds of thousands of children. Those are the words the American people used when they allowed this government to sanction Iraq. And this is something many people forget. And we can’t forget. </p><p> We’ve just learned that we’ve killed over a million Iraqis since the invasion. But we already killed a million Iraqis in the ’90s through sanctions and bombings prior to this invasion. But the number is truly much higher.</p><p> When I got to Iraq in 2003 I learned a new word and that word was “Hajji”. Hajji was the enemy. Hajji was every Iraqi. He was not a person, a father, a teacher, or a worker. And it’s important, we’ve heard this word alot during Winter Soldier but it’s important to understand where this word came from and to Muslims the most important thing is to take a pilgrimage to Mecca. It’s the Haj. And taking this pilgrimage is the Hajji. And, it’s something in traditional Islam that is the highest calling in their religion. So we took the best thing from Muslim and made it into the worst thing. </p><p> But, history did not start with us and since the creation of this country, racism has been used to justify expansion and oppression. The Native Americans were called savages. The Africans were called all sorts of things to excuse slavery. And Vietnam veterans know of the multitude of words used to justify that imperialist war. So, Hajji was the word we used…it was the word we used on this particular mission I’m going to talk about and we’ve heard alot about different raids and kicking down doors of people’s houses and ransacking their houses. But this mission was a different kind of raid. I never got any explanation for these orders. We were only told that this group of houses, of five or six houses, were now property of the U.S. military and we had to go in and make those families leave those houses. </p><p> So, we went to these houses and informed the families that those homes were no longer their homes. We provided them no alternative, nowhere to go, no compensation. And they were very confused and very scared and did not know what to do, would not leave, so we had to remove them from those houses. One family in particular, a woman with two small girls, very elderly man and two middle-aged men, we dragged them out of their houses and threw them onto the street and arrested the men because they refused to leave. Uh, arrested the old man and sent them off to prison. And, at that time I didn’t know what happened to people when we tied their hands behind their back and put a sandbag over their head. </p><p> Unfortunately, a few months later, I had to find out. We were short interrogators so I was assigned to work as an interrogator. I oversaw and participated in hundreds of interrogations, one in particular I’m going to share with was a moment for me that really showed me the nature of this occupation. This particular detainee…when I was sent to interrogate him he was stripped down to his underwear, hands behind his back, and sandbag on his head. I never actually saw this man’s face. My job was to take this metal folding chair and just smash it against the wall next to his head, he was faced against the wall with his nose touching the wall while a fellow soldier asked the same questions over and over again, no matter what his answer, my job was to slam this chair against the wall. </p><p> We did this until, basically, we got tired. And, I was told to make sure he stood against the wall for however long and I was guarding this prisoner and my job was to make sure he kept standing up. But I noticed that there was something wrong with his leg and he was injured and he kept, like, falling to the ground. And the sargeant in charge would come and tell me to get him up on his feet so I’d have to pick him up and put him against the wall and he kept going down and I’d have to keep pulling him up and putting him against the wall. And my sargeant came around and he was upset with me for not, you know, continue making him to stand. He picked him up and slammed him against the wall several times and then he left and when the man went down on the ground again I notice blood pouring down from under the sandbag. And so I let him sit and I noticed my sargeant coming again and I would tell him quickly to stand up and I realized that I was supposed to be guarding my unit from this detainee and I realized at that moment that I was guarding the detainee from my unit. </p><p> And I tried hard to be proud of my service but all I could feel was shame and racism could no longer mask the occupation. These were people. There were human beings. I’ve since been plagued by guilt anytime I see an elderly man, like the one who couldn’t walk and we rolled onto a stretcher, told the Iraqi police to take him away. I feel guilt anytime I see a mother with her children like the one who cried hysterically and screamed that we were worse than Saddam as we forced her from her home. I feel guilt anytime I see a young girl like the one I grabbed by the arm and dragged into the street. </p><p> We were told we were fighting terrorists, but the real terrorist was me and the real terrorism is this occupation. Racism within the military has long been an important tool to justify the destruction and occupation of another country. It has long been used to justify the killing, subjugation, and torture of another people. Racism is a vital weapon deployed by this government. It is a more important weapon than a rifle, a tank, a bomber or a battleship. It is more destructive than an artillery shell, or a bunker buster, or a tomahawk missile. While all of those weapons are created and owned by this government, they are harmless without people willing to use them.</p><p> Those who send us to war do not have to pull a trigger or lob a mortar round. They do not have to fight the war. They merely have to sell the war. They need a public who is willing to send their soldiers into harm’s way and they need soldiers who are willing to kill or be killed without question. They can spend millions on a single bomb, but that bomb only becomes a weapon when the ranks in the military are willing to follow orders to use it. They can send every last soldier anywhere on earth, but there will only be a war if soldiers are willing to fight, and the ruling class: the billionaires who profit from human suffering care only about expanding their wealth, controlling the world economy, understand that their power lies only in their ability to convince us that war, oppression, and exploitation is in our interests. They understand that their wealth is dependent on their ability to convince the working class to die to control the market of another country. And convincing us to kill and die is based on their ability to make us think that we are somehow superior. Soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen, have nothing to gain from this occupation. </p><p> The vast majority of people living in the US have nothing to gain from this occupation. In fact, not only do we have nothing to gain, but we suffer more because of it. We lose limbs, endure trauma, and give our lives. Our families have to watch flag draped coffins lowered into the earth. Millions in this country without healthcare, jobs, or access to education must watch this government squander over $450 million a day on this occupation. Poor and working people in this country are sent to kill poor and working people in another country to make the rich richer, and without racism soldiers would realize that they have more in common with the Iraqi people than they do with the billionaires who send us to war.</p><p> I threw families onto the street in Iraq only to come home and find families thrown onto the street in this country in this tragic, tragic and unneccesary forclosure crisis; only to wake up and realize that our real enemies are not in some distant land. But not people whose names we don’t know, and cultures we don’t understand. The enemy is people we know very well and people we can identify. The enemy is a system that wages war when it’s profitable. The enemy is the CEOs who lay us off our jobs when it’s profitable; it’s the insurance companies who deny us health care when it’s profitable; it’s the banks who take away our homes when it’s profitable. Our enemies are not 5000 miles away, they are right here at home. If we organize and fight with our sisters and brothers, we can stop this war, we can stop this government, and we can create a better world.”</p><p> - Mike Prsyner, PSL member and anti-war veteran</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

Boulder DA's Office, 20th Judicial District - DA Michael Dougherty is functioning as a vehicle of white supremacy in his refusal to drop these trumped up charges against this sister after years of enduring vile behaviors like the use of racial slurs against her children. We are in fierce support of Mrs. Jeweldine Kastman and her family, and we demand a full dismissal of all charges against them. Call Da Dougherty&rsquo;s office and demand he dismiss this case today and everyday until it is done! (720) 470-7871<br />
Boulder County case number 19CR1876<br />

[Image Description: BLM5280 letterhead featuring the BLM5280 skyline logo on a white background with a deep grey border reading the following:<br />
November 11 2020<br />
We, the members of Black Lives Matter 5280, after careful consideration of Mrs. Jeweldine Kastman&rsquo;s case, believe she has been the victim of prejudice in the criminal justice system. Our core values demand we take personal responsibility for denouncing the kind of discrimination, harassment, and racism Mrs. Kastman has experienced in Boulder County. Further, we believe the District Attorney has a responsibility to the public to reexamine her case through an unbiased lens. We believe that acknowledgment and reconsideration of the implicit biases in this case should lead to the conclusion that the interests of justice require that Mrs. Kastman's case be dismissed.<br />
Mrs. Kastman moved to Colorado just a couple of years ago having never experienced the kind of blatant racism she would encounter from her neighbors here. cont. in comments]]]></content:encoded>

We also hold close the reality that if we are to continue the fight for racial justice, we must work harder than ever to hold the Biden-Harris administration, Congress, the Supreme Court, our state and local go...vernments, our neighbors, and our families accountable to the leadership of Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities, most notably the Black women and femmes who, despite their tireless work toward liberation, will be the most adversely affected by harmful policy decisions inevitably to come. </p><p> It will also take a tremendous amount of effort to work toward repairing the damage that centuries of racism has caused in this country, let alone that which has been concentrated within the past four years. Our work won’t get easier, it will just look different. We are as committed as always to amplifying the work of Black, Brown, and Indigenous community leaders, and we will never stop striving toward a more antiracist world.

The Democrats  did very badly in the rest of the election. They lost seats to the  Republicans in the House and they failed to win the Senate. The fact  that it was a close election at the presidential level at a time of the  biggest healthcare catastrophe and mass unemployment in living memory  shows how little the Democratic Party has to offer the masses of people.  The Democratic Party ruling class establishment ado...pted a center-right  orientation and refused to embrace the demands for Medicare for All, a  cancellation of rents and mortgage payments during the pandemic,  canceling student debt or meaningful policing reforms.</p><p> The task at hand is to build a mass movement demanding that the Biden  White House take immediate emergency measures to eradicate mass  unemployment, provide a livable guaranteed income for all of those who  have been made jobless; cancel rents, evictions and foreclosures; cancel  student debt and adopt a Medicare for all healthcare system. At the  same time, we have to mobilize greater opposition to U.S. militarism and  war, which is not even slightly diminished under a government led by  Joe Biden.</p><p> Read the full statement on Liberation News: <a href="https://www.liberationnews.org/psl-statement-the-defeat-of-donald-trump/">https://www.liberationnews.org/psl-statement-the-defeat-of…/</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1075522266233596">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/a.378847259234437/1075522209566935/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s851x315/124199045_1075522212900268_8698469464218033619_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=2&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=B4uNTk44ZUoAX8dmXz8&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=7&oh=9a2ef0e2cd40f78c9913ce1864b8f7d5&oe=5FD5F13F" alt="Image may contain: 5 people, people standing, crowd and outdoor, text that says 'Trump is the symptom Capitalism is the disease Revolution is the cure Party for Socialism and Liberation PSLweb.org FSL'" width="500" height="313" caption="Image may contain: 5 people, people standing, crowd and outdoor, text that says 'Trump is the symptom Capitalism is the disease Revolution is the cure Party for Socialism and Liberation PSLweb.org FSL'" /></a>]]></content:encoded>

With the recent outbreak, COVID 19 threatens the lives of everyone imprisoned. #DetentionIsDeadly. <br />
<br />
Immigration and Customs Enforcement&rsquo;s decision to return to business as usual and its GEO detention center in Aurora are not keeping our community safe, and experts agree, the only answer is to #FreeThemAll. Just last month, Dr. Carlos Franco Paredes called for compassionate humanitarian release of all imprisoned people.  Join us Monday, November 9th at 6:00 pm at 3130 Oakland in Aurora for a Caravan around the detention center and virtually on FB Live. We will hear from family and impacted individuals and from the Colorado Immigrant Freedom Fund about how your donations can free our people! This event is brought to you by the American Friends Service Committee, the Colorado People&rsquo;s Alliance, the Colorado Freedom Fund AND the Immigrant Freedom Fund of Colorado. <br />

La decisi&oacute;n del Servicio de Inmigraci&oacute;n y Control de Aduanas de volver a la normalidad y su centro de detenci&oacute;n GEO en Aurora no mantiene a nuestra comunidad segura, y los expertos coinciden en que la &uacute;nica respuesta es #FreeThemAll. El mes pasado, el Dr. Carlos Franco Paredes pidi&oacute; la liberaci&oacute;n humanitaria compasiva de todas las personas encarceladas. &Uacute;nase a nosotros el lunes 9 de noviembre a las 6:00 pm en 3130 Oakland en Aurora para una caravana alrededor del centro de detenci&oacute;n y virtualmente en FB Live. &iexcl;Escucharemos a familiares e individuos afectados y al Fondo de Libertad de Inmigrantes de Colorado sobre c&oacute;mo sus donaciones pueden liberar a nuestra gente!

Even if it might seem innocuous (i.e. complaining that your neighbors play loud music late at night) it can make neighbors (particularly BIPOC, unhoused, etc. folks) more vulnerable to police violence.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SURJDenver/posts/2744208419186647">See More</a><a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_YK1tzg48QPez5snL9Di1rg">Welcome!

<br />
A BLM protestor was ran over on their scooter this summer wearing a BLM mask in Denver and many in community feel that it's a major DPD coverup. <br />
<br />
Chris was wearing a BLM mask, he tried to get his friends out of harms way and the driver redirected and targeted him, plowing into a group of black kids and killing Chris. All the kids are from out of town and coming back for the DPD press conference Tuesday <br />
<br />
Tomorrow we expect police to say they found the car but no driver and DPD may even be closing the investigation b/c the car was supposedly reported stolen before the incident.]]></content:encoded>

It is a vile, outlandish, and ...funny-if-it-wasn’t-scary document that details violent fantasies they desperately long to make real.</p><p> One thing this document makes clear: the far right is chomping at the bit to hurt Black Lives Matter protestors.</p><p> They hate the anti-racist rebellion that has gripped this country since cops murdered George Floyd. They hate to see oppressed people fight back. And they hate to see solidarity with the very groups they attempt to scapegoat. </p><p> These white-nationalist, patriot militia-types think cops aren’t repressing the movement violently enough, so they’re volunteering to do more. The Colorado Unorganized Constitutional Militia document, for instance, upholds Kyle Rittenhouse’s double-murder as an example that, “as patriotically awesome as it was to watch, we need to learn from.”</p><p> Right-wing vigilantism attempts to reinforce social inequality and uphold the status quo, not to subvert them. Historically, privatized and vigilante violence has been central to maintaining the racial and social order in the United States. Examples include the KKK, volunteer border patrols, the bosses’ private security forces, and white-on-Black race riots. </p><p> The militia’s violent fantasies transform cities like Denver into war zones. They claim that “not knowing where you are will get you killed,” as if there is danger inherent to urban neighborhoods. Playing to the fears of their mostly white, suburban and exurban, petit-bourgeois membership—the historic social base of fascism—helps motivate them toward violence.</p><p> The ultimate dream of these fascists is for their racist, rapist president to go beyond instructing them to “stand back and stand by” and give them the go-ahead to kidnap and kill protestors. They consider it an imminent possibility and they are actively making plans for that day.</p><p> Some highlights:</p><p> * The militia considers itself at “war with political driven [sic] Marxist groups.” </p><p> * The document is saturated with militaristic buzz words and concepts, like a chain of command and required combat gear.</p><p> * It details rules of engagement for “operating against BLM and Antifa,” which it refers to as “adversaries” and “enemies.”</p><p> * It instructs the militia to “be violent” and “shoot to kill, never to wound,” when they deem it justified via their pseudo-legalistic framework.</p><p> * It details what kinds of weapons to use, including pistols with at least 30 rounds and 9mm capacity, “long guns” in “mobile units,” knives, hard-knuckle gloves, and wasp spray.</p><p> * In addition to instructions to kill protestors, it suggests kidnapping them. For this purpose, militia members are instructed to carry zip ties and a “couple ripped up t-shirts for gags and blind folds.”</p><p> * It uses Trump’s racist phrase “China virus.”</p><p> * The document culminates in a bleak vision that demands the militia’s violent action. It claims the US is “entering into very dark times” when “patriots” are outnumbered and “under attack from Marxist [sic] that aim to destroy everything we have built.”</p><p> * It ends with the white-supremacist, neo-Nazi rallying cry, “Until Valhalla.” That’s an appropriate ending for a self-aggrandizing death cult.</p><p> Here’s the full document: <a href="https://gofile.io/d/dTxESt">https://gofile.io/d/dTxESt</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

The Aurora Fire Chief notified council members of a COVID-19 outbreak at the GEO detention facility this afternoon. There are 19 confirmed positive cases!

(Hint: we think it should include abolishing the police.) <br /> We share many others' skepticism about task forces like these, but we know and respect many of the conveners of this forum..., we believe in community engagement even when skepticism is warranted, and as the saying goes, "if you're not at the table, you're probably on the menu." So we hope to see many people attending with a critical eye and an open mind.

Así se habla! </p><p> Firme la petición para exigir que Univisión y Telemundo deja de alimentar la anti-Ne...gritud: <a href="https://bit.ly/lasvidasnegrasimportan">bit.ly/lasvidasnegrasimportan</a> </p><p> "Entiendo que va haber mucho dolor en este momento para nuestra comunidad pero también tenemos una responsabilidad de hacer conección de todo lo que está pasando. Por que la comunidad Negra está marchando y protestando en estos momentos? Porque la policía sigue matando a la gente Negra. Porque la patrulla fronteriza está matando a nuestra gente en la frontera entonces mi llamado ahorita en nuestra comunidad es pensar más allá de nosotros, hacer todas las conecciones, tomar las calles, organizarnos para que toda esta violencia puede terminar. Y ustedes como Univisión tienen responsabilidad de contar toda la historia de todo lo que esta pasando así como hablamos de las deportaciones ustedes también tienen que hablar por que la gente sigue muriendo en manos de la policía, particularmente la gente Negra. Ese es mi llamado. En este momento hacer negocio con esta administración es una traición a la comunidad Negra y a las familias que siguen muriendo."</p><p> ******<br /> Sign the petition to demand Univisión and Telemundo stop their antiBlack coverage:  <a href="https://bit.ly/lasvidasnegrasimportan">bit.ly/lasvidasnegrasimportan</a>  </p><p> "I understand that there is going to be a lot of pain right now for our community but we also have a responsibility to make connections between everything that is happening. Why is the Black community marching and protesting right now? Because the police are still killing Black people. Because border patrol is killing our people. So my call to action right now in our community is to think beyond us, make these connections, take to the streets, and organize so that all this violence can end. And you as Univision have a responsibility to tell the whole story of everything that is happening, just like how we talk about deportations, you also have to talk about why people keep dying at the hands of the police, particularly Black people. That is my call to action. Right now doing business with this administration is a betrayal of the Black community and the families that continue to die.

We see this new community-driven service as a form of preventative medicine for police violence. If it had been in place long ...ago, could have prevented the deaths of Elijah McClain, Michael Marshall, Paul Castaway, Paul Childs, and countless other victims of police violence in Denver. <br /> Abolition is not a metaphor - it's a tangible possibility, and this is an important example of how our communities can start to build the alternatives to modern policing that we need to keep our communities safe. We can have a world without police. We can have a world without prisons.
