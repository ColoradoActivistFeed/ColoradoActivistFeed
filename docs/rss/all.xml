      <title>Peaceful protesters are facing huge prison sentences. People are being charged for defending themselves against white supremacist terrorists because the police are ideologically aligned. This is fascism.</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll address this to the cops reading, because they&#39;re the ones who obviously least understand what&#39;s happening here.</p> <p>People just wanted some better ways to be involved in the &#39;good&#39; side of law enforcement, instead of always feeling like your enemies. We just wanted some accountability for the bad apples who went too far, and for enforcement to be a bit more consistent and a bit less arbitrary.</p> <p>People protested non-violently, peacefully. No one tracked down cops to their homes and threw molotovs into your windows. No one went out and shot up cops in revenge for any of the stuff your bad apples did.</p> <p>People just wanted justice, and all they&#39;ve done is asked for it. When we think the system is unjust and it refuses to change, we can be loud and we can get in the way of things because it&#39;s important to us, but we don&#39;t go committing the types of massacres that have are all-too frequently perpetrated by right-wing extremists.</p> <p>It doesn&#39;t seem to matter what people do, you refuse to give even the smallest concessions. You protect your bad apples until all that&#39;s visible to the outside world is rot. You brutally attack people who non-violently ask for these small changes. You help extremists commit terror attacks.</p> <p>And now, you want to put peaceful protesters in prison. People have done nothing to hurt anyone, to whom the worst accusations you can make are that they walked and they spoke and you didn&#39;t like where they walked and what they said.</p> <p>What do you think is going to happen when people peacefully demanding justice know that they&#39;ll face life in prison for marching? What remains, for the people who think that this injustice cannot stand without doing something?</p> <p>Your intention, of course, was to make people afraid that if they protest, they will go to prison for life. Your idea was that people who fight for justice will stop fighting because they will not want to spend their lives in prison.</p> <p>I hope I&#39;m wrong, but the flip side to your imprisoning peaceful people for life is that some who were remaining peaceful may make the calculation that now all paths towards justice lead to prison anyway. Those options that were off the table before may not seem as extreme when the consequence is life in prison regardless... <em>if they get caught</em>.</p> <p>Because when weighing up options for getting justice now, the decision must be made between publicly protesting and facing the wrath of a fascistic legal system, or taking more covert action.</p> <p>I hope that this is just my own anxieties and that all the charges are dropped against people who have been non-violently asking for justice. After seeing the horrible LASD ambush the other day I know that <em>no one wants to live a world where anyone thinks that kind of violence is their only way to obtain justice</em>.</p> <p>JFK quote here.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ilivoVovili"> /u/ilivoVovili </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iv4zn7/peaceful_protesters_are_facing_huge_prison/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iv4zn7/peaceful_protesters_are_facing_huge_prison/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

A peace officer shall not seize a recording or recording device without consent, without a search warrant or subpoena, or without a lawful exception to the warrant requirement.” <sup>• An officer can request to “obtain from a person a device used to record an incident involving a peace officer in order to access the recording as possible evidence in an investigation.” Tell them “I do not consent or volunteer to you taking my camera.” • (e</sup> Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a peace officer has the authority to temporarily seize and maintain control over a device that was used to record an incident involving a peace officer for no longer than seventy-two hours to obtain a search warrant when exigent circumstances exist such that the peace officer believes it is necessary to save a life or when the peace officer has a reasonable, articulable, goodfaith belief that seizure of the device is necessary to prevent the destruction of the evidentiary recording while a warrant is obtained.)</li> <li>You must avoid &quot;interfering&quot; with the investigation/actions. It is a good idea to STATE that you are a reasonable distance away for your video&#39;s audience (whether it be the courts if your camera gets seized, or just for viewers on a livestream. Try to take away any ambiguity or room for interpretation. In Boulder, this means staying at least 8 feet away; I did NOT FIND ANY SPECIFIC DISTANCE FOR DENVER, so if the police say to move back, that might be precedence to say you are interfering.</li> </ol> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Alarmed_Chard_4568"> /u/Alarmed_Chard_4568 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iuy9pg/guidelines_on_filming_police_your_rights_your/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iuy9pg/guidelines_on_filming_police_your_rights_your/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone. A few of us from the Boulder County NAACP Education Committee are working on a statewide bill to address disproportionate discipline of students of color, especially Black students, in Colorado schools. Key components of the bill would be: </p> <p>- Removing police officers (also known as SROs) from all day-to-day school operations; research shows that increases in SROs result in increased disproportionate discipline of Black and low-income students, decreases in high school graduation rates, and decreases in college enrollment rates. In Colorado schools, students of color and special education/504 plan students are disproportionately referred to law enforcement and/or arrested in school. Ideally we would like to see them replaced with social workers, counselors, etc. for day-to-day behavioral issues. </p> <p>- Increased accountability/data reporting around school discipline; For example, currently &quot;other action&quot; is the most commonly used category in the discipline data, and it could range from anything as mild as a detention to something as severe as a legal citation. This catch-all category inhibits transparency. There is also no data released about interactions between race and SPED/504 status. This is important to see - a Black SPED student, for example, could face multiple forms of bias and be even more negatively impacted by these discipline practices. </p> <p>- Teacher training around implicit bias and discipline practices; currently this is up to the districts - some districts are very enthusiastic about training teachers in this area and some refuse to do it, or keep it very minimal. &quot;Train the trainer&quot; models have proven effective for other areas of teacher training and can be implemented at a fairly low cost. </p> <p>Please fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Mp3VdV303beVUISgzVbkqv-1IuJ5FnKQv9wbXBFZdKI/edit">this google form</a> if you&#39;d like to get involved in our efforts. We&#39;re looking for help with outreach, email/admin management, partnership with other community organizations, eliciting testimony from students/parents, research on funding for SROs (varies by district), data analysis, and more. We&#39;re hoping to move quickly on this so any help is appreciated! </p> <p>You can also email us at [<a href="mailto:co.safeschools.bill@gmail.com">co.safeschools.bill@gmail.com</a>](mailto:<a href="mailto:co.safeschools.bill@gmail.com">co.safeschools.bill@gmail.com</a>).

City officials can make this announcement directly delivered to the camp in writing, or send it to info&#064;denverhomelessoutloud.org and we will deliver it to residents for the City. </p><p> If the City needs assistance finding housing or hotels for the roughly 60 residents of this encampment, they need look no farther than the thousands of vacant luxury apartments and hotels. The City can hold master leases on apartments and rent those to people according to their income. They can also set up long term leases at hotels as they move forward in buying vacant hotels. </p><p> Homelessness ends with a home. This is possible. The time is now.

Our communities stand to suffer the most in struggling to survive due to the effects of Covid-19 on our loca...l economy from which our elected officials have refused to protect us. There are too many wealthy neighborhood developers on the sidelines waiting to pounce on the opportunity to use Covid-19 as a vehicle for gentrification. We will not sit idly by while that happens when we have the means to help prevent it. </p><p> Please complete this google form with basic information about your family’s financial need, location, and how you can best receive our assistance. Funds will be disbursed via check whenever possible, but will also be made accessible to families who are not able to receive checks at this time. The maximum amount awarded to any family at one time will be $2500 to remain consistent with covering at least one month of the median single-family home cost of rent in Denver, CO currently.

Hay demasiados compañías de construcción de vecindarios para gente rica esperando la oportunidad de usar COVID-19 como un pretexto para gentrificación. No nos quedaremos con los brazos cruzados viendo lo qué pasa cuando podemos ayudar a prevenir esa situación.</p><p> Por favor llene este formulario de Google para obtener información de las necesidades económicas de su familia , dirección, y cómo podemos darle ayuda. Los fondos serán distribuidos por medio de cheques pero también será accesible para los que no pueden recibir cheques. La cantidad máxima otorgada a una familia es $2,500. Actualmente es el costo de alquiler de una casa para una familia en Denver, CO. Solicitantes pueden pedir ayuda otra vez  pero los que solicitan por primera vez tendrán prioridad.</p><p> <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRWyksu7rQ7s5aOvAYHsBehsknpjVNz7Q2dVqmwZqISK66_A/viewform">https://docs.google.com/…/1FAIpQLSfRWyksu7rQ7s5aOv…/viewform</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackLivesMatter5280/posts/2668753166775233">See More</a><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRWyksu7rQ7s5aOvAYHsBehsknpjVNz7Q2dVqmwZqISK66_A/viewform">Create a new survey on your own or with others at the same time.

Naturally, this was an extremely traumatizing event, and I preferred to spare the details from the world partly for privacy but mostly for shame. What they did to me was not only cruel and unusual, but I would even go so far as to call those men’s actions that night pure evil. But tonight I am forced to share with you all this in hopes you will stand in solidarity with me as I stand trial against felony charges that could land me years in prison. It would mean the world to me if you all could take a few minutes to read this and repost my story if you feel comfortable with that.</p><p> The reason I feel forced to share my story, or even share prematurely is because of the circumstances of this trial. The night of the protest I was arrested for “disarming a peace officer” - they say I stole a pepper ball gun from one of the officers. Disclaimer, I didn't… but I’ll get to that later - After being discharged from jail due to my deteriorating medical condition, I quickly found an excellent law firm to help represent me. Over the next 4 weeks, my legal team visited DPD twice a day, requesting all the evidence such as footage from a street surveillance camera, and the officer's body cams. When they did not comply, I turned to my friends in the political realm. After a few state legislators reached out on my behalf, for the most part we were met with silence. As privileged as I was to have these politicians advocating for me, DPD still would not budge. The only discovery presented by the police so far, 6 weeks after my arrest, is a probable cause statement-making claims that can be quickly and easily disproved by a video of the arrest that night, provided by a fellow protestor. In all the years my lawyers have been practicing in Colorado, they have never once seen evidence be withheld to such a degree. And with all the stories of shady arrests going down, it is honestly starting to scare me.</p><p> Unfortunately, now I know what a panic attack feels like. I now know the tight squeezing feeling that grips my chest, that the doctors call anxiety. The fact that I can't live without an irrational fear of being outside alone at night (something women have ALWAYS to deal with!!!!). The reason for this is because of the exact way the arrest went down that night. It was without any warning nor any chance to cooperate. I was grabbed from behind while I was standing, leaning against a fence. What happened next occurred in the blink of an eye. I was thrown to the ground face first. All of a sudden I started getting beaten by several officers, kicked and hit with a baton. I was grabbed by the hair on my scalp, my head was lifted off the ground, and I was punched multiple times in the face. My muffled screams for my girlfriend, for any help, were quickly snuffed out. Then an officer decided to take his baton, and forcibly shove it into my rectum. My “fight or flight, friend or freeze” instincts kicked in, and my body went numb. Everything that happened after that felt like a blur. I begged and pleaded for them to tell me what I had done wrong and why I was being arrested, but the only response I received was being told “We don’t gotta tell you SHIT… shut the FUCK up”</p><p> After spending the night in the hospital concussed and handcuffed to my gurney, I was finally thrown in jail. The worst of my charges: disarming an officer??? and violently resisting arrest?!? All absolutely untrue. I did not do it, and there is a video that shows all of this. My deepest gratitude goes out to the unnamed protestor who reached out with the video. I am not a violent man. Peace is my first language, anyone who knows me can tell you that.</p><p> These officers must face the law. I still don't even know the names of my assaulters. They remain anonymous, STILL ON DUTY. How long until they sexually assault another victim, or even murder someone. How long until another “hashtag”.</p><p> Please share this. If you feel comfortable, even share a short story, or some time you have personally witnessed the amount of love I pour into activism, and this community… I live to help. Tag Jared Polis. Tag Mayor Hancock. Tag DA Beth Mccann, DPD, tag em all. Community, I need you all now more than ever. I love you all. Thank you.</p><p> Link to video of arrest: <a href="https://streamable.com/3pn8wa">https://streamable.com/3pn8wa</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

Black men is unacceptable. Property can be replaced, Black Lives cannot," she maintains.</p><p> ...</p><p> “The arrests are violent, resulting in broken bones and other serious injuries. The criminal charges are being inflated to increasingly serious offenses. Protesters are being forced to risk their safety and freedom in order to exercise their right to free speech," said Jessica Jones — a local criminal defense attorney and volunteer organizer for the Colorado NLG. "It is a sad paradox that protesters experience police violence as they protest police violence."</p><p> In addition to violent policing tactics in the name of crowd-control, Denver Police recently began invoking a little-used ordinance that was originally passed in anticipation of the 2008 Democratic National Convention protests. The law bans activists from carrying protective equipment, chains, and bike locks.</p><p> "This ordinance has allowed police to criminalize activists before a protest has even started," said Jones.</p><p> <a href="https://www.westword.com/news/denver-protest-arrests-likened-to-minority-report-11797388">https://www.westword.com/…/denver-protest-arrests-likened-t…</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php">See More</a><a href="https://www.westword.com/news/denver-protest-arrests-likened-to-minority-report-11797388">Possession of a helmet can allegedly lead to an arrest.<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDOHMSP4BLR8TPy&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages1.westword.com%2Fimager%2Fu%2Foriginal%2F11798121%2Fprotest_may30_eps_02.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQAD8Tds3vkIjeOM" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>westword.com</p><p>Claim: Denver Police Busting Protesters for Protecting Themselves</p>Possession of a helmet can allegedly lead to an arrest.<a href="https://www.westword.com/news/denver-protest-arrests-likened-to-minority-report-11797388">Possession of a helmet can allegedly lead to an arrest.</a>]]></content:encoded>

Reports of solitary confinement for speaking out about it... also not new. ⁣<br /> ⁣<br /> We’ve heard all this & more directly from detainees here in Aurora. We spent all summer watching guards exit & enter without masks, watching ambulances come & go under the cover of night, hearing from detainees & newly released people that the outbreak numbers were severely underreported. ⁣<br /> ⁣<br /> Reports of mass sterilizations of unwilling or coerced women... also not new. The U.S. government has been sterilizing women of color without their consent since the colonizers got here. ⁣<br /> ⁣<br /> The Nazis even got it from us. Literally. Concentration camp “doctors” were inspired by the systemic sterilization of Indigenous women in California. And just ten years ago, the governor of CA finally got around to banning the sterilization of prisoners as a form of birth control. ⁣<br /> ⁣<br /> But this week, a lot more people are paying attention. ⁣<br /> ⁣<br /> Thanks to a brave whistleblowing nurse in Georgia, the veil is lifting a little more, and ICE is losing more of that secrecy it needs so badly to keep violating human rights under the guise of patriotism. ⁣<br /> ⁣<br /> They can build fence after fence to hide the truth & hide from us... but their evil is still clear, and it’s getting clearer. Make no mistake: it’s deliberate, it’s systemic, and it’s long past time to dismantle it by any means necessary. ⁣<br /> ⁣<br /> If not now, when? Serious question.

Mariposa at the Althea Center, in partnership with NY-based Immigration Equality and American Friends Service Committee Colorado, will present &ldquo;Immigration is an LGBTQ Issue: Love Across Borders,&rdquo; 4-week series of programs highlighting some of the traumatizing circumstances and critical needs of our LGBTQ sisters and brothers seeking asylum in the United States.<br />
 <br />
With simultaneous Spanish/English interpretation provided for Zoom participants, we will hear powerful and personal migration stories from current and recent LGBTQ asylum seekers. PFLAG Las Cruces, NM, will share their &ldquo;real life&rdquo; model of hosting asylum seekers, for which they won an award last year from the national PFLAG organization. We will hear from national and local leaders doing the day-to-day work of assisting and supporting these asylum seekers. <br />

Can we make it to 25k??!</p><p> It is half way through September and we have made just over $14,000 toward maintaining our Sanitation Stations at encampments!! That is huge!!! THANK YOU SOOO MUCH to all of you who have donated to make this possible! With this amount we can pay for at least September and October. If we make another $11,000 by the end of this month we will have enough to pay for these services at the 5 encamp...ments we are currently serving for the rest of 2020! </p><p> What does this pay for exactly?? Five portable toilets serviced 5 days a week, moving charges after police sweeps, pay for a resident of the encampment to do an extra cleaning of the portable toilet each day, cleaning supplies, and some of the supplies to maintain the handwashing stations (done together with Mutual Aid Denver). </p><p> Again, we must note, this should be the city’s responsibility. The city currently has a contract with Liberty Waste that could pay for portable toilets and handwashing stations at every encampment around town. CDC guidance tells cities to provide these sanitation resources to every encampment of 10 people or more. But they continue to ignore our demand that this basic human resource be provided. We will continue to make this demand heard…</p><p> In the meanwhile… your donations to pay for toilets and handwashing ensures at least 5 encampments, totaling at least 350 people, have access to a toilet and soap and water to wash their hands. Something every person needs and deserves. </p><p> Please share this call for donations with your friends and family!  </p><p> You can donate on paypal, check, or with cash as laid out on this link.</p><p> <a href="https://denverhomelessoutloud.org/donate/">https://denverhomelessoutloud.org/donate/</a></p><p>  </p><p> If you donate, please note "for sanitation resources" so we can keep track of the fund coming for this need. </p><p>  </p><p> Please contact us with any questions, donations, or ongoing funding. </p><p>  </p><p> We are over half way toward funding these services for the rest of 2020… let's make this happen!!</p><p>  </p><p> Contact us at: </p><p> info&#064;denverhomelessoutloud.org</p><p> 720-940-5291</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/1993088597487750">See More</a><p>denverhomelessoutloud.org</p><p>Donate</p>Here are some ways you can help with the finances… 1.

The others still remain homeless.</p><p> With all the lies Hancock has spouted about the cities intent in the past do you really think we can afford to believe him now?  We need 50 or so of these camps to meet the need.  One in basically every neighboorhood.  Hancock has stated the city  wants to set up 2 or 3 camps.  In light of the need for at least 50 of these to meet the need can they be considered anything but  “photo op” camps?</p><p> What about those who cannont squeeze in?  Expect them to be crimiminalized harshly.   And that will be the majority of our homeless population.   </p><p> As far as the site in the article, it was slated to receive notification for a sweep a little over a week ago.  They called the sweep it off last min due to the weather event last week and some prodding of the folks working on setting the first SOS camp up.  Think about it, the 1st welcoming sanctioned place was going to get swept to make it a “welcoming”place for the homeless.   Perhaps the people who are already there are not the “right kind” of homeless people.  Which, if you think about, it begins to sound racist.  Homelessness always have a heavy dose of racism mixed in.  <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/09/12/mayor-hancock-homeless-campsite/">https://www.denverpost.com/…/mayor-hancock-homeless-campsi…/</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/1992189524244324">See More</a><a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/09/12/mayor-hancock-homeless-campsite/">Mayor Michael Hancock said a small strip of city-owned property between Sonny Lawson Park and the Blair-Caldwell Library could a possible place for individuals to set up campsites in a controlled e…<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDFkAfpHLLIT2xM&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.denverpost.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F06%2FTDP-L-MAYOR-HANCOCK-PRESSER-PROTESTERS_JAC1203x.jpg%3Fw%3D1024%26h%3D772&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQC2PTpq_7GQK_af" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>denverpost.com</p><p>Denver identifies possible designated campsite for those experiencing homelessness</p>Mayor Michael Hancock said a small strip of city-owned property between Sonny Lawson Park and the Blair-Caldwell Library could a possible place for individuals to set up campsites in a controlled e…<a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/09/12/mayor-hancock-homeless-campsite/">Mayor Michael Hancock said a small strip of city-owned property between Sonny Lawson Park and the Blair-Caldwell Library could a possible place for individuals to set up campsites in a controlled e…</a>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Please see our <a href="https://mailfence.com/pub/cal/denverprotestsdaily?a=1">new calendar</a> for the most complete list of upcoming vetted events. </p> <p>Events are color coded as follows:</p> <ul> <li>red: rally/protest/march</li> <li>purple: campaign (an event allowing activity spanning across several days)</li> <li>blue: government meeting</li> <li>yellow: education/training</li> <li>green: news</li> <li>orange: panel</li> <li>black: vigil</li> <li>pink: mutual aid</li> </ul> <h1>Wiki</h1> <p>To avoid repeating too much information from day to day, we&#39;ve created the beginnings of a wiki <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/wiki/index">here</a>. Your feedback is much needed, as this is my (TaroPeril&#39;s) first experience with a reddit wiki. It contains links to livestreamers, your rights as a protestor, and more.</p> <h1>News</h1> <p>DPD shot two men in the span of 72 hours last week - <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/09/11/denver-police-shooting-west-high-school-identified/">Antonio Blackbear, the cousin of Paul Castaway</a> on September 10 and then <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/09/12/denver-police-shooting-saturday-west-colfax/">one as-of-yet unnamed man</a> on September 12. Then, they broke up a memorial service for Antonio Blackbear on the night of Friday, September 11, and <a href="https://twitter.com/__ovas__/status/1304662954735030272?s=20">arrested several protestors</a>. </p> <p>The Denver City Council will also be voting on the collective bargaining proposal agreed upon by Mayor Hancock and DPD. This proposal guarantees a 2.77% raise for all of DPD, at a time when other city departments are being furloughed and otherwise having their budgets slashed. <a href="https://www.westword.com/news/denver-city-council-poised-to-reject-police-bargaining-agreement-11788153">Five councilmembers have so far stated publicly that they will vote against this proposal</a>, which was negotiated behind closed doors. Only two more councilmembers are needed for a majority. If they turn down this proposal, this will be the first time ever that such an agreement has been rejected by the City Council. Contact your rep today!</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://sentinelcolorado.com/news/metro/aurora-council-committee-axes-2-proposals-approves-another-targeting-military-devices-tear-gas/">Aurora City Council axed a proposal by CM Marcano to ban the use of tear gas and other military-grade equipment by APD</a>. Marcano plans to edit the measure and bring it forward again. Mayor Coffman, of course, wrote that &quot;I believe that having these additional tools makes it less likely that our police department would ever have to resort to options that could cause physical injury, such as the use of wooden billy clubs, that can cause bone fractures, or rubber bullets, that can cause permanent loss of an eye, to accomplish the same purpose of (dispersing) a crowd (that) is becoming violent.” Did he not see that APD used everything at its disposal at various protests in Aurora this summer?</p> <p>A group called Community E also led a group of about 30 protestors <a href="https://sentinelcolorado.com/news/metro/demonstrators-confront-aurora-lawmaker-at-her-home-sunday-protesting-death-of-elijah-mcclain/">to the home of CM Bergan to protest the death of Elijah McClain</a>. There will be future protests. As this one was not sanctioned by the mother of Elijah McClain, it was not added to the calendar, but if future ones focus on other topics, they will be added to this thread and to the calendar.</p> <h1>Notable Events</h1> <h3>September 14</h3> <p><strong>4:00 PM - 6:00 PM</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/afrofrontco/status/1301688029447434240?s=21">Can You Hear Us Now?</a> (Twitter post)</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> Afro Liberation Front</p> <p><em>Location:</em> East steps of City Hall (1437 Bannock St, Denver, CO)</p> <p><em>Host-provided information:</em> Currently, the city charter of Denver prohibits bargaining over officers’ discipline, policing policies, and oversight.

Calls to the Boulder Shelter, prior to ...the cold weather, resulted in staff telling the caller that there would be no severe weather shelter provided.</p><p> This death was preventable. People suffering frostbite and going to the hospital was preventable. Who knows how many suffered but didn't make it to get medical care.</p><p> "The man, who was not named, was found unresponsive Wednesday morning in the parking lot of Unity Church, 2855 Folsom. Paramedics and fire responded and administered CPR before transporting the man to Boulder Community Health, where he was pronounced dead.</p><p> “Boulder Community Hospital believes the male died of cold weather exposure, as his core body temp was 75 degrees,” the blotter item reads. An investigation is ongoing.</p><p> The temperature Tuesday night into Wednesday dropped to 30. Boulder received 4 inches of snow overnight, the Daily Camera reported."</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/1990450664418210">See More</a><a href="https://boulderbeat.news/2020/09/12/57-year-old-man-dies-in-boulder-snowstorm/">Boulder officials believe the death of a likely unhoused man, found near his camp, was a result of exposure to cold weather.<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQB7VCKCe59bR9mN&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fboulderbeat.news%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F08%2FIMG_20200811_090753920.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQASNvBRb67E_Au4" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>boulderbeat.news</p><p>Police blotter: 57-year-old unhoused man dies during Boulder snowstorm</p>Boulder officials believe the death of a likely unhoused man, found near his camp, was a result of exposure to cold weather.<a href="https://boulderbeat.news/2020/09/12/57-year-old-man-dies-in-boulder-snowstorm/">Boulder officials believe the death of a likely unhoused man, found near his camp, was a result of exposure to cold weather.</a>]]></content:encoded>

Allende and a core of his staff resisted until the fascist troops stormed the building. Allende was killed.</p><p> By afternoon, all government offices in the country were taken over. Within weeks, thousands of leftists, intellectuals, unionists and supporters of Allende were rounded up and tortured in the National Stadium. Many were executed. Congress was suspended, unions and political parties banned, and habeas corpus eliminated.</p><p> Among these desparecidos was famous Communist poet and singer Victor Jara. Born into poverty to a peasant family, by the age of 6 Jara was already working on a farm. Yet he became a distinguished theater director and played a pivotal role in establishing the Nueva Canción Chilena movement.</p><p> Before Jara was murdered, soldiers smashed his fingers and then mocked him, handed him a guitar and forced him to play a song. In a display of immense revolutionary resilience, with broken hands Jara sang the song that was the anthem of the movement, Venceremos – We Will Triumph. Jara’s life was brutally taken by army lieutenant Pedro Pablo Barrientos. Barrientos who played Russian roulette with Jara until a shot finally rang out. He was then shot another 44 times, and his body  dumped in the street along with the hundreds of others.</p><p> In his final hours, Jara composed one last song on a scrap of paper. The song ends, “How hard it is to sing when I must sing of horror... What I see, I have never seen, what I have felt and what I feel, will give birth to the moment.”</p><p> Victor Jara’s legacy will live on forever in his music and perseverance. No amount of guns, tanks, prisons, or unjust laws can stop the movement towards justice.</p><p> ¡Víctor Jara presente!</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

Last night, in a last-minute mobilization, 125 gathered with Antonio Blackbear’s mother, wife, daughter, aunt, and other relative...s to protest his murder by Denver Police two days ago.</p><p> We began with an Indigenous prayer and remarks from family members, including Lynn Eagle Feather, Antonio’s hunka (adopted) aunt, whose son, Paul Castaway, was also murdered by Denver Police five years ago. </p><p> With friendly cars following us, we marched a mile from the Capitol Building past the downtown police headquarters and chanted “Cops! Pigs! Murderers!” at the cops guarding the fence they erected around it. We asked them, “Which one of you killed Antonio Blackbear?” and later, when we confronted some sheriff’s deputies, “Which one of you killed Michael Marshall?”</p><p> At the site of Antonio’s murder, family members gathered around a candle-filled memorial and told the crowd about their lost relative. Antonio’s mother expressed how touched she was by the presence of so many who were outraged by the shooting. It was painful to witness yet another family reeling from the shock of the police taking the life of their beloved relative.</p><p> The march returned to the Capitol and happened to pass a Starbucks along the way, the windows of which proved to be an irresistible temptation. After most of us had dispersed and gone home, two truckloads of riot cops advanced on those that remained. They were clearly coming for a couple of protestors and we were unable to prevent them from doing so. Two were arrested and won’t be able to be bailed out until Monday. Donations for bail can be made to Colorado Freedom Fund: <a href="https://fundly.com/coloradofreedom">https://fundly.com/coloradofreedom</a></p><p> Thank you to Antonio’s family, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nativelivesmatter1/">Native Lives Matter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AnonResistanceMovement/">Anon Resistance Movement</a>, and all who showed up against racist police violence!</p><p> “When Indigenous lives are under attack, what do we do?

On Wednesday, Sept 9, they shot and killed Antonio Blackbear, a 41-year-old Lakota man.<br />
<br />
Antonio was the adopted cousin of another Lakota man killed by the Denver Police five years ago, Paul Castaway. Indigenous people are more likely than any other racial group to be killed by police. <br />
<br />
There has been no semblance of justice for Paul in that time, since Denver District Attorneys, like their counterparts around the nation, refuse to hold police accountable for the violent, racist terror that forms the very core of their job description. We expect the fight for justice for Antonio to be a similarly difficult one.<br />
<br />
The police have yet to release video of their killing of Antonio, nor say much about it, because they are working to craft a story that casts them in the best light.<br />
<br />
Justice for Antonio Blackbear!<br />
Defund, disarm, and disband the police!]]></content:encoded>

Some of these people moved back the night after the swe...ep, others a few days after, but in any case folks have been living on these blocks since the sweep with no indication that the area is “closed.” </p><p> At least 6 people will show up today to find all their property gone. One of these people, Van, showed up shortly after the police had just trashed, not stored, his tent and all his property. This is the same man who stood his ground against the police on one leg at the sweep two weeks ago. All of the residents of this area are scattered to nowhere...</p><p> After coming in and taking these people’s property around 12noon, one resident - David - showed up on site as the city was about to grab his property. The police agreed to give him two hours to pack and move. Just after 2pm police showed up, walked up and arrested Daivd at 2:14pm for “disobeying a lawful order” aka being 6 minutes late to move his property as he was actively in the midst of moving his property. Police did not give him any warning or any time when they walked up on him at 2:14pm to arrest him. They just threw him in handcuffs and told him he was under arrest. </p><p> A few minutes later, another man - Allen - who had just had his property taken from the city two hours earlier and walked up to it being gone, came back to the area since we had found someone to give him a ride to try to get his stuff from storage and he was immediately arrested. Police claimed he was on body camera footage threatening an officer and arrested him for “threats to an officer.” This same officer who he supposedly threatened, was caught on camera pushing his car door into Allen and grabbing his arm and pushing him back. This was all as Allen was trying to ask officers for business cards after his property had just been taken. Two hours later police proceeded to arrest him with great force and had him on the ground for over 30 minutes. </p><p> You don’t have to look any farther to see the intersection of racism, homelessness, and police brutality. Police arrested these men for NOTHING because that is what police do to homeless black people. Enough is enough.</p><p> Thanks to community members who are bailing these men out of jail. </p><p> Watch livestream and others on our facebook of these sweeps and arrests <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/videos/716517545872124/">https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/videos/716517545872124</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/1988439837952626">See More</a><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t15.13418-10/119105525_402008110787160_2075018125510989478_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&_nc_sid=f2c4d5&_nc_ohc=ekFv2Ze3TPQAX8DxV1G&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&oh=6f9fe909198e7ea0e92a850c6262fec1&oe=5F8A0FAC" /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/">Denver Homeless Out Loud</a> was live.<a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/videos/716517545872124/"></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com"><i></i></a>]]></content:encoded>

We are currently only at 1 C warming and already experiencing extreme weather and devastation around the globe. The much-touted Paris Agreement’s voluntary commitments have us on target for 3 C warming, when scientists warn that staying below 1.5 C warming is what is needed to avert catastrophe. </p><p> Despite being in charge of the wealthiest country in the world, the... U.S. government — Democrat and Republican — is doing nothing to mitigate or prepare for the looming catastrophe. Even in the liberal bastion of California, state leadership is not taking the crisis seriously. California is the fifth largest economy in the world, yet there is no money for people’s needs while Big Tech gets tax breaks.</p><p> If humanity is to survive this crisis, we must immediately put all resources into preparing for what’s currently unfolding and what’s to come. We must immediately transition off fossil fuels and restore ecosystems that capture carbon from the atmosphere. We must protect the population from climate disasters and provide real relief for people in the aftermath.</p><p> Capitalism has proven time and again that it is incapable and unwilling to meet the needs of the people. If we don’t uproot the system that has created the climate crisis, that continues to ignore it and go about business as usual, the majority of us face a truly dire not-too-distant future. The people have the power to change the path we are on — to share the challenges together and build a better world for all.”</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1025424461243377">See More</a><a href="https://www.liberationnews.org/govt-silent-as-climate-change-unfolds/#.X1pslpHoqTI.facebook">San Francisco skyline tainted orange from wildfire smoke, Sept. 9 As I write this article from San Francisco, Calif., the sky is dark orange and I need to have my desk lamp on to see, despite that it’s midday.

As you may know, Sza Sza Codner or Jennifer Codner is a Jamaican trans woman detained at Aurora Contract Detention Facility.<br />
<br />
Sza Sza endured violence and persecution in her country of origin which drove her to seek asylum and refuge here. Since then she's been ferried from one immigrant prison to the other, subjected to solitary confinement, targeting and harassment from guards, placed in men's facilities, and a host of other horrible atrocities.<br />
Help end her indefinite imprisonment by pushing for her release.<br />
<br />
Sza Sza has court this Friday, 9/11 and we are determined to assist in getting her out of detention and towards safety.]]></content:encoded>

Though an appeal to the state Supreme Court is in the works, this means that potentially for most of this winter, the criminal punishment system will deny our unhoused neighb...ors the basic human right to not only safe, affordable housing but to camp undisturbed without having their homes and property "swept" and stolen/trashed under the orders of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverdoti/">Denver Department of Transportation and Infrastructure</a> or the Denver Department of Public Health and Environment. (Let's be real, though - we know you're behind these orders, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/5280mayor/">Michael B. Hancock</a>).</p><p> A recent study by the municipal public defender's office found that 30% of the people caught in the revolving door of the municipal court system are Black (Denver is 10% Black), and that 38% of total municipal court cases involve unhoused people charged with minor, nonviolent violations directly related to homelessness.</p><p> Racial justice is intersectional justice - please continue to support organizations like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/coloradodashr/">Denver Alliance for Street Health Response</a> who work with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/">Denver Homeless Out Loud</a> to ensure that our unhoused neighbors have what they need to survive this winter. <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/supporting-dashr039s-community-response">https://www.gofundme.com/f/supporting-dashr039s-community-r…</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SURJDenver/posts/2692175781056578">See More</a><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/supporting-dashr039s-community-response">Denver Alliance for Street Health Response (DASHR) is an organization focused o… Vinnie Cervantes needs your support for Supporting DASHR's Community Response<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDTNoUoaYJwrWBv&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net%2F48934810_1592509035270542_r.jpeg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQAuCSMb-QBmBKDq" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>gofundme.com</p><p>Supporting DASHR's Community Response, organized by Vinnie Cervantes</p>Denver Alliance for Street Health Response (DASHR) is an organization focused o… Vinnie Cervantes needs your support for Supporting DASHR's Community Response<a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/supporting-dashr039s-community-response">Denver Alliance for Street Health Response (DASHR) is an organization focused o… Vinnie Cervantes needs your support for Supporting DASHR's Community Response</a>]]></content:encoded>

For more details contact WAR at the email address below. All are welcome, masks are encouraged:<br /> On Thursday, September 24, 2020, Women Against Registry and others dedicated to ...change in America’s sexual offense registration laws will be in front of the 10th Circuit Appeals Court building from 8 AM to 2 PM to protest the 10th Circuit’s ruling. The message is simple – the registry IS punishment. As we know it has altered the lives of human beings who merely want to have their lives fully restored.</p><p> We invite each and every person experiencing the punitiveness and stigma of registration to join us. Each man, woman or child can make a difference. Begin right now making plans to be part of the demonstration and/or donating to the initiative to help with travel, lodging, materials and brochures which are being designed as we speak. It will be a great time to meet others from like-minded organizations and be a part of something BIG!<br /> Let us know if you will be joining us so that we can keep you apprised of on-going plans and developments.</p><p> For more information, contact... 10thcirteam&#064;warfamilyfoundation.org”</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

We'd like to echo that call - let’s flood their registration process or let them know directly why trainings like this are dangerous and problematic and should be called off by emailing christie.mochoruk&#064;denvergov.org.</p><p> Why is this training a bad thing?</p>...<p> A department that has demonstrated again and again that it has no respect for the lives of our BIPOC neighbors, people experiencing homelessness, or protesters has no business teaching the community how to protect itself.</p><p> There is no way the racism baked into policing cannot replicate itself in how they teach neighbors to spy on each other (they can’t even keep it out of their logo - a menacing, featureless image of a "suspicious" black man).</p><p> The “intruder” mentality built by Neighborhood Watch programs, when combined with racial bias, results in vigilante murders like that of Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery.</p><p> Neighborhood Watch teaches communities to fear each other, to watch for “outsiders”, to surveil each other, and to rely on the threat of police violence to feel “safe”. True safety comes from communication, empathy, and mutual aid. Cops don't keep us safe, we keep us safe.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SURJDenver/posts/2689577174649772">See More</a><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EhBwXwUXcAYHvc_.jpg"><img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDzV7DarhpZkQtk&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fmedia%2FEhBwXwUXcAYHvc_.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQBWS0GyfyLR-yrj" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>pbs.twimg.com</p><p>pbs.twimg.com</p><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EhBwXwUXcAYHvc_.jpg"></a>]]></content:encoded>

HAPPENING NOW: Your mayor and council members are meeting to discuss the 2-year contract with #DenverPoliceDepartment that increases their budget in the second year. This budget increase allows for MORE funds devoted to the chemical weapons they terrorize our city with!  They plan to quietly vote on it tomorrow 9/3 with only online public comment that they can control the narrative on with the click of a button. Contact your council member and Michael B. Hancock TODAY and let them know as their constituent you DEMAND they do not support the following:<br />
<br />
❌Any Collective Bargaining Agreement with DPD longer than 1 year. <br />
<br />
❌Any agreement that gives ANY financial increases or incentives to police. <br />
<br />
❌Any agreement that does not require police to be financially responsible for their attorneys and settlements in any cases of alleged excessive force or race related discrimination<br />

His age and respiratory ailments put him at risk of serious illness and death if he contracts COVID-19. With over hundreds of active cases in Colorado’s prisons, his family fears he will not make it out alive. His daughter, Amber, says, “In prison, he can’t protect himself and he can’t social distance. My deep fear is that my dad will die in prison. That is a...n awful, traumatic reality to consider. My chest is tight just thinking about how quickly it spreads and how vulnerable he is.” </p><p> Governor Hickenlooper shortened his sentence following testimony from family, friends and correctional officers advocating for his early release. Yet, he is still eight years away from parole. While he remains in prison, COVID-19 continues to spread. Ronald’s three siblings, four children and four grandchildren are desperate for his release.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/acluofcolorado/posts/3499408936759237">See More</a><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/118464736_1057883024670238_5027461490615456778_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&_nc_sid=f2c4d5&_nc_ohc=jpR3yLCl4CQAX91u9k5&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&oh=fa052223b22eb5f2264428ecf7e9d1ea&oe=5F88A478" />]]></content:encoded>

Still, we must never normalize watching and reading about any violence enacted on our friends and loved ones, pieces of ourselves, on the internet. We give thanks to the ancestors and higher power that guided #JacobBlake back to share more joyful moments with his children like the one in this picture we are intentionally sharing instead of that horrific video. Today we are reminded that it is an essential component of #Blackliberation to take pause and hold space for our whole selves &mdash;body, mind, and spirit. To choose healing. #Blackhealingisrevolutionary #BlackLivesMatter]]></content:encoded>

I’m not talking about it’s close cousin white guilt. Penitenti...al whiteness differs from white guilt in that it is vocal. It’s more than a feeling...it falls over itself to outperform and out woke every other white “ally.” </p><p> Penitential whiteness might look and sound desirable, but I can guarantee you that it absolutely is not. It is exhausting. </p><p> Penitential whiteness is a paradox. </p><p> It demands labor by performing labor. Instead of lending quiet support behind the scenes, it is loud and in front. It needs the cookies and badges from Black people. If no cookies are given, there is an assumption that something went wrong, and so the penitential white person become insecure and needs to make sure they’re still a “good person.” </p><p> It centers itself by de-centering whiteness. Penitential whiteness makes sure that everyone knows that they are not in the center by telling everyone that they aren’t in the center. They are in the center of all of the fe-centering. </p><p> Penitential whiteness does everything at full steam. If it’s calling out other white folks penitent white folks will be the loudest and most persistent. If it is if it’s raising awareness, you can expect a full, scripted pitch. If it is showing up, it will be the first one there and the last to leave. </p><p> Penitential whiteness, on the surface, might seem like a healthy expression of allyship (or whatever y’all calling it right now). The difference between being a healthy co-conspirator and a penitential white individual is about posture. Penitential white folks can do good work, but that good work is rooted in relieving the pressure to prove their goodness rather than in the liberation of others. </p><p> Beware and be wary of penitential whiteness. It’s not a good look. At the end of the day, penitential whiteness does more harm than good because the “work” of a penitential person of whiteness is rooted in their zeal to prove themselves. </p><p> Penitential whiteness does not combat white supremacy, it reinforces it by—once again—making people of whiteness the hero of their own narratives. The narrative, in this case, is being The Best Ally That Ever Allied and sucking all of the air (and liberation) out of the room. </p><p> I don’t expect everyone to understand or agree with this word. But I hope that it will at least get folks thinking about how they approach the work of antiracism.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

Last Wednesday, when 40+ DPD officers brutalized community members assisting unhoused neighbors with sweeps, we drew a line in the sand. Enough is enough!</p><p> We demand justice for our unhoused neighbors, as well as the families of William Debose, Alexis Mendez-Perez, Paul Castaway, Michael Marshall, Marvin Booker, Ryan Ronquillo, Jessie Hernandez and the thousands of people in our city impacted by state-backed violence. The Denver City Council has failed to hear our calls for justice, liberation and abolition. We know that human rights only come alive when citizens organize, protest, boycott, rebel and violate the law in order to uphold justice!</p><p> Twelve comrades were arrested last night. Some were released on PR bond but we still have 3 bonds of $500 each to pay and two comrades with bond not allowed until court on Monday afternoon. Please help raise the ransom for these brave rebels and get them out of cages with an active COVID outbreak! Let's get our comrades back to their loved ones, their pets and their jobs tonight!</p><p> As the election approaches, we are looking to make an active bail fund for rebels. Any excess monies will be put into this revolving fund as we work to create it!

The program provides a more appropriate and more humane approach to crisis involving homelessness, mental health, and substance use. The CAHOOTS program answers about one-fifth of the 911 calls in Eugene and saves the city on average $8 million per year. DASHR’s efforts, alongside other community groups and partners, resulted in the launch of the new STAR (Support Team Assisted Response) pilot program in Denver on June 1st. </p><p> Since January, DASHR has also been working with members of Aurora’s City Council to explore building a model similar to CAHOOTS. “Aurora currently has a co-responder model, but we know that a police presence can escalate a situation,“ said Councilwoman Allison Hiltz who chairs the public safety committee on council. “In looking at other models, we are better able to prioritize our community’s needs and rethink how we deliver mental health care.” She plans to present a brief update on their progress at a committee meeting on August 27, with hopes for a more complete proposal in the near future. </p><p> Natalia Marshall, whose uncle Michael Marshall was killed in the Denver jail noted that this type of response could prevent similar things from happening. “My uncle Michael had schizophrenia and when he called police to report his bible as stolen, he was met by police officers instead of mental health professionals who brought him to the jail, which led to his death.” She adds that he needed mental health services not jail. Natalia is an Aurora resident and activist for alternatives to police and criminal justice reform.</p><p> DASHR strongly believes in creating alternatives to policing, jail, and the prison industrial complex more generally. “I believe we’re in a critical moment where the ideas we’ve been fighting to achieve for years are finally getting the attention and consideration they’ve always deserved,” said Vinnie Cervantes, Organizing Director of DASHR. “It’s important that our solutions are truly alternatives to systemic harm and that they are led by the community” DASHR is committed to helping facilitate community involvement in the programs.</p><p> About DASHR<br /> Denver Alliance for Street Health Response (DASHR) is a coalition of groups and individuals who create and support community- based responses to crisis and conflict, as well as forge new narratives of public health and safety.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
Many of us in the Coalition to Close the Concentation Camps knew that it was time to take action against forces of fascism and evil- especially for our families impacted by this broken immigration system.  On July 12, 2019, radicals and impacted families split from the milquetoast Lights for Liberty vigil being conducted at the Aurora ICE Processing Center. Rebels marched  into the parking lot of GEO- where anticolonial speeches were given by indigenous youth and where the now infamous flag removal occurred. <br />
<br />
Following the flag removal and international embarrassment, the Aurora Police Department began a Twitter manhunt offering a $4k reward to identify suspects from that evening; violent crimes typically only get a $1k reward and we knew this outrageously large reward was made because two anti police flags were flown that night. Cowards at APD wouldn't fire or prosecute the murderers of Elijah McClain the following month, yet APD had the time and resources to target non-violent protestors demanding justice for immigrants.<br />
<br />
The woman featured in this powerful photo, Michelle, was eventually identified by non profit &quot;allies&quot; and served misdemeanor tampering charges; Michelle's case with Aurora dragged on for over a year. Today we have some good news: our hero was found NOT GUILTY by jury trial and walks free of all charges! Fuck APD!<br />
<br />
Michelle- you are an inspiration and a true Chingona. With you, our city sent a message to the Department of Homeland Security.  Your bravery, in addition to the life Willem Van Spronsen gave on July 13th 2019 by setting ICE's kidnapping vans in Tacoma ablaze, made ICE retreat on their planned nationwide mass arrests of immigrants.<br />

Black August, first commemorated by our incarcerated brothers and sisters, is a time to recommit ourselves to the struggle for #BlackLiberation and to honor those who&rsquo;ve contributed to our collective progress and all those who have been lost to unjust violence and systemic racism.<br />
This August 21, join us in a car protest to bring the Black August fight to our local prison walls. We will drive in a mobile protest to the Denver County Jail and the GEO Aurora ICE detention facility to let those who are chained there know that we are with them, we are fighting for them, and we will keep fighting until all chains are broken.<br />
The many injustices faced by those behind bars in the U.S. are today amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Prisons and jails all across the country, where medical neglect is commonplace and quarantining impossible, have become hotspots of infection. Hundreds have died in US prisons from COVID-19, and yet no response has been made to defend against unnecessary death. The mass incarceration of Black, Brown, and Indigenous populations means that they are not only disproportionately affected by the virus outside of jail, but inside as well.<br />
We raise the following demands, recognizing that if they are not met, more unnecessary death is a certainty:<br />
1. Immediate humanitarian release of all ICE detainees and all vulnerable inmates, those convicted for non-violent offenses, and those who have not been convicted at all.<br />
2. Where people remain behind bars, drastically increase medical staffing and supplies to local jails and state prisons, and guarantee sanitary conditions for all inmates.<br />
3. Free all political prisoners!<br />

We are not asking for a release. They have the..." /></a><br><br>&quot;All we are asking is to be transferred back to the Aurora facility. We are not asking for a release. They have the authority to transfer us immediately if we want,&quot; says Jimmy Sodhi, a 45-year-old ICE detainee.<br />
<br />
Sodhi is part of a group of eight ICE detainees who have been housed in the same dormitory at the Teller County Jail since being transferred there from the Aurora Contract Detention Facility one month ago. Sodhi and the other ICE detainees began the hunger strike on the morning of August 10 to protest what they allege are significantly worse conditions at Aurora GEO.<br />
<br />
&quot;As a Sikh, I'm not allowed to wear my Sikh bracelet, I'm not allowed to cover my head. If I have to pray, it's required for me to cover my head. I'm told to cover my head with a pillowcase or a towel,&quot; says Sodhi, who has been in ICE custody since March 2017 and is currently in the appeals process of his deportation case stemming from a fraud conviction for insider trading. &quot;That is very demeaning, very disrespectful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sodhi notes that he was allowed to wear his turban at the Aurora detention facility, but has been told by staff at the Teller County Jail that he cannot retrieve his turban from his personal belongings. Same with prayer books, Sodhi adds, which he hasn't been able to obtain, being told by staff that &quot;there's no chaplain here and we don't have those here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Additionally, Sodhi contends that he and other ICE detainees at the Teller County Jail have been subjected to racial harassment perpetrated by non-ICE detainees staying in the same dormitory.<br />
<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
Adding to his angst, Sodhi contends that he and the other detainees don't even know why they're being housed in the Teller County Jail, which has an agreement with ICE to house immigrant detainees.<br />

(Hint: we think it should include abolishing the police.) <br /> We share many others' skepticism about task forces like these, but we know and respect many of the conveners of this forum..., we believe in community engagement even when skepticism is warranted, and as the saying goes, "if you're not at the table, you're probably on the menu." So we hope to see many people attending with a critical eye and an open mind.

NOW WE MUST FIGHT FOR THEM, TOO</p><p> "We know this fight is far from over. In many ways, it’s just beginning. DACA was made possible thanks to the organizing efforts of young immigrants, many of them queer, who pushed President Obama to announce it in the summer of 2012...For many of us, including myself, DACA was never the end goal. We knew in 2012 that DACA was supposed to be a stepping stone towards liberation and protection for all our families, especially those who are often deemed not deserving of rights. Our end goal is the safety and liberation of all people, but especially of trans and queer undocumented people."</p><p> - Jorge Gutierrez, Familia; Trans Queer Liberation</p><a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/3167062/supreme-court-daca-decision-oped/">The Supreme Court upheld the Obama-era policy, but there is still work to be done to protect the most vulnerable among us<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQCDA14HbAH7LmV3&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmtv.mtvnimages.com%2Furi%2Fmgid%3Aao%3Aimage%3Amtv.com%3A693512%3Fquality%3D0.8%26format%3Djpg%26width%3D1440%26height%3D810%26.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQBmxyeOsMpIDma1" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>mtv.com</p><p>DACA Was Made Possible By Young LGBTQ+ Immigrants.

Así se habla! </p><p> Firme la petición para exigir que Univisión y Telemundo deja de alimentar la anti-Ne...gritud: <a href="https://bit.ly/lasvidasnegrasimportan">bit.ly/lasvidasnegrasimportan</a> </p><p> "Entiendo que va haber mucho dolor en este momento para nuestra comunidad pero también tenemos una responsabilidad de hacer conección de todo lo que está pasando. Por que la comunidad Negra está marchando y protestando en estos momentos? Porque la policía sigue matando a la gente Negra. Porque la patrulla fronteriza está matando a nuestra gente en la frontera entonces mi llamado ahorita en nuestra comunidad es pensar más allá de nosotros, hacer todas las conecciones, tomar las calles, organizarnos para que toda esta violencia puede terminar. Y ustedes como Univisión tienen responsabilidad de contar toda la historia de todo lo que esta pasando así como hablamos de las deportaciones ustedes también tienen que hablar por que la gente sigue muriendo en manos de la policía, particularmente la gente Negra. Ese es mi llamado. En este momento hacer negocio con esta administración es una traición a la comunidad Negra y a las familias que siguen muriendo."</p><p> ******<br /> Sign the petition to demand Univisión and Telemundo stop their antiBlack coverage:  <a href="https://bit.ly/lasvidasnegrasimportan">bit.ly/lasvidasnegrasimportan</a>  </p><p> "I understand that there is going to be a lot of pain right now for our community but we also have a responsibility to make connections between everything that is happening. Why is the Black community marching and protesting right now? Because the police are still killing Black people. Because border patrol is killing our people. So my call to action right now in our community is to think beyond us, make these connections, take to the streets, and organize so that all this violence can end. And you as Univision have a responsibility to tell the whole story of everything that is happening, just like how we talk about deportations, you also have to talk about why people keep dying at the hands of the police, particularly Black people.

We see this new community-driven service as a form of preventative medicine for police violence. If it had been in place long ...ago, could have prevented the deaths of Elijah McClain, Michael Marshall, Paul Castaway, Paul Childs, and countless other victims of police violence in Denver. <br /> Abolition is not a metaphor - it's a tangible possibility, and this is an important example of how our communities can start to build the alternatives to modern policing that we need to keep our communities safe. We can have a world without police. We can have a world without prisons. And we are already on our way to building it.<br /> Read more about the STAR program in our joint press release with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/">Denver Homeless Out Loud</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/coloradodashr/">Denver Alliance for Street Health Response</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/harmreductionactioncenter/">Harm Reduction Action Center</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RecoveringDenver/">Mental Health Center of Denver</a>here: <a href="http://www.denverjusticeproject.org/2020/06/08/press-release-alternative-public-health-emergency-response-pilot-launches-in-denver">www.denverjusticeproject.org/…/press-release-alternative-pu…</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverJusticeProject/posts/3110110802376621">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverJusticeProject/photos/a.900402720014118/3110107502376951/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/103066453_3110107505710284_8653334129786094722_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=hdJA0b5gA-UAX-9r4tn&_nc_oc=AQnV470qCL6EoVcya-4lDLgtvddIAwnzYvzp3_VismSUKbB4d3IeNQGasoc5EWI7DpA&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&oh=3541215b36deaedb5794e240a69b2a65&oe=5F8940BA" alt="Image may contain: text that says 'YOU ARE EXPERIENCING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS & AFRAID IMAGINE...

Lorena Borjas no esta con nosotrxs físicamente pero su espíritu de lucha vive en cada persona que la conoció y sabemos que nosotrxs continuaremos su lucha, siempre!</p><p> ¡Lorena Borjas, Presente!</p><p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/lorenaborjas">#LorenaBorjas</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/transmigrantwomen">#Transmigrantwomen</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cofamiliatqlm/posts/2415630091872181">See More</a><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4agmmm/lorena-borjas-legendary-trans-latinx-activist-dies-of-covid-19?utm_campaign=sharebutton">Borjas was known for advocating for trans women in prison, those in need of housing, legal representation, and healthcare.
