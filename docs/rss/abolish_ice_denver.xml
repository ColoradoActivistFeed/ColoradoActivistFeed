She’s the sole provider and breadwinner since her husband, Ivan, was deported last year. Hilda is a community leader with the American Friends Service Committee in Colorado. </p><p> This past week, Hilda was in the El Paso area to visit family. On January 27, 2021 HIlda was traveling with other people in a vehicle and they were stopped at a Border Patrol checkpoint. She was arrested and is now charged with "smu...ggling Ixxxxxl aliens”. She is detained at he Dona Ana County Detention Center in New Mexico awaiting hearings this week. Funds will support her legal fees and her children.</p><p> Hilda is a quiet person in her daily life, but outspoken and fearless in the face of injustice. When her husband was detained by ICE and then held for 8 months at the GEO facility in Aurora, CO Hilda worked tirelessly to advocate for his release . The family helped to expose the lack of access to medical care and mishandling of contagious diseases in detention. At the beginning of the pandemic, she led <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/freethemall">#FreeThemAll</a> calls to action at both detention centers and jails.  </p><p> Even after her husband’s deportation, and despite the challenges of being a single mother, she remained committed to fighting for the human rights of all. She has testified in favor of bills at the state capitol and met with many Colorado congresspeople to advocate for just and humane immigration reform and the elimination of immigration detention centers.  Most recently she advocated for the new congress to finally tackle an overhaul of our immigration policies, participating in two public direct actions in January alone.  </p><p> Hilda’s own immigration case has been slowly winding through the system as she complies with everything asked of her.  She applied for asylum as she is very afraid to return to Mexico due to persecution there and is currently in the US on humanitarian parole. Hilda was also the victim of a home invasion and attempted homicide here in the US while awaiting asylum. She has a UVISA application pending from this incident."</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AbolishICEDenver/posts/773401946602718">See More</a><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/bring-hilda-home-financial-solidarity">*Sigue en español* Hilda Martinez Murillo has four children, between the age… Jennifer Piper needs your support for Bring Hilda home - Financial solidarity<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQH--yNlc9jTOejq&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net%2F54328538_1612192954977876_r.jpeg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQG7RzT5066Xt8Kt" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>gofundme.com</p><p>Bring Hilda home - Financial solidarity, organized by Jennifer Piper</p>*Sigue en español* Hilda Martinez Murillo has four children, between the age… Jennifer Piper needs your support for Bring Hilda home - Financial solidarity<a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/bring-hilda-home-financial-solidarity">*Sigue en español* Hilda Martinez Murillo has four children, between the age… Jennifer Piper needs your support for Bring Hilda home - Financial solidarity</a>]]></content:encoded>

She arrived to the U.S. when she was just five years old, and through DACA she’s been able to pursue higher education, work for Denver Public Schools as a family liaison, and have a family of her own. She’s now applying for her residency, which is an incredibly expensive process, so she’s selling enchiladas this weekend to help raise money to cover the costs. You can order at <a href="https://solidaritymeals.paperform.co/">https://solidaritymeals.paperform.co.</a> Pickup will be in Denver this weekend, and money can be sent via Venmo to &#064;/tania-baez-30.

After winning the election, his advisers said unwinding the many policies would take time, largely due to the pandemic.</p><p> During Mr. Biden's first day in office, his administration stopped placing asylum-seekers in the so-called "Remain-in Mexico" program. He is also set to formally end the policy and other asylum limits this week as part of an executive order to retool how U.S. border officials will process migrants going forward.<br /> But the new administration continues to use the Trump-era CDC order to quickly expel migrants — including families with children — without allowing them to request U.S. refuge, according to court documents and interviews with attorneys. The government has also not said whether it will allow the estimated 20,000 migrants in Mexico with pending asylum applications to continue their cases inside the U.S."</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AbolishICEDenver/posts/772746380001608">See More</a><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-immigration-trump-border-policies/#app">U.S. border agents continue to expel migrants, including families with children, without court hearings under a policy instituted by the Trump administration.<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQGWP1_OZV-LSSaZ&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcbsnews3.cbsistatic.com%2Fhub%2Fi%2Fr%2F2021%2F01%2F31%2Fc1eb917a-2101-4f66-b6d8-8cf02ce13617%2Fthumbnail%2F1200x630%2Fbe0859af497808aa199a9f1e8ebd1e9d%2Fgettyimages-1189671037.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQF_P-S_9ylKBvI0" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>cbsnews.com</p><p>Biden retains Trump's border rules for now, with migrants stuck in Mexico or facing expulsion</p>U.S. border agents continue to expel migrants, including families with children, without court hearings under a policy instituted by the Trump administration.<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-immigration-trump-border-policies/#app">U.S. border agents continue to expel migrants, including families with children, without court hearings under a policy instituted by the Trump administration.</a>]]></content:encoded>

She arrived to the U.S. when she was just five years old, and through DACA she’s been able to pursue higher education, work for Denver Public Schools as a family liaison, and have a family of her own. She’s now applying for her residency, which is an incredibly expensive process, so she’s selling enchiladas this weekend to help raise money to cover the costs. You can order at <a href="https://solidaritymeals.paperform.co/">https://solidaritymeals.paperform.co.</a> Pickup will be in Denver this weekend, and money can be sent via Venmo to &#064;/tania-baez-30.

<br />
What better way is there to show solidarity other than showing up, making some noise &amp; closing out this shit show of a year together? Show up with your best NYE noise makers, demonstration banners and signs. Who knows, we may even try out a new flavor of Pig face? Fed or Jeffco anyone?<br />
<br />
We are planning on meeting up at Harriman Lake Park at 7:30 pm at W Quincy Ave &amp; S. Kipling Pkwy, then heading to the facility which is across the street at 9595 W Quincy Ave Littleton, CO  80123.<br />
<br />
**Neither we, nor the other organizers of this action, are affiliated in any way with Eric King nor the Eric King Support team @SupportEricKing. We all just want to show some love and and we are happy to signal boost that!**<br />
<br />
&ldquo;I have been incredibly fortunate to have so many people come into my life and take a stand with me so that I didn&rsquo;t have to face this shit alone&hellip; From the smallest greeting to the big gestures, everything has meant so much to me&hellip; Now that said, I stand by my actions... After seeing what happened in Ferguson, so close down the road, I was disgusted by the lack of mobilization in my city. Three hours away people were fighting for their lives and we weren&rsquo;t even taking to the streets. We were doing nothing. My act as a very personal display of my anger and rage toward the state as well as an act of solidarity to everyone in Ferguson. We never know our own strength until we are tested and even with my ridiculous sentence I feel at least proud to have been able to stand strong and refuse to cooperate with the state. I am just really happy that I don&rsquo;t have to take this alone and have so many amazing people standing next to me. Until all are free.&rdquo;<br />
&mdash; Eric King<br />

<br />
&ldquo;The Facility&rdquo; is a short documentary film chronicling the lived experiences of immigrants being held at the GEO detention facility in Aurora, Colorado. This film addresses the personal loss and consequences caused by for-profit detention and the federal government's broken immigration policies. Legal and medical experts highlight horrific abuses including death, medical neglect, nutrition issues, and prolonged detention during the coronavirus pandemic. To tell their stories, current and former detainees, families fighting to be reunited, and advocates come together to share their experiences behind the walls of the GEO immigration detention facility in Aurora.<br />
