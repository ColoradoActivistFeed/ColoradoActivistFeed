Bergen C...ounty Correctional Facility has a new contract with ICE to detain undocumented people in inhumane conditions. In response to this some of the detainees have thrown a hunger strike to demand their immediate release- this hunger strike has lasted over 30 days and nothing has changed regarding the conditions or their release. There is no such thing as “illegal aliens” don’t let the language fool you into demonizing the true natives of this land. Don’t let political terms such as “annexed” or “treaty” fool you into believing that stripping people from their families is legal. The hypocrisy of America to deport people who come to this country for a better life is deadly and shameful.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

He has rejected the science and has relied on his bias, inserting his beliefs and feelings into when and whom have access to the vaccine. He used his authority to change the recommendation. </p><p> We all know someone that is in jail, prison and/or sometime experiencing homelessness. To deny them early access to the vaccine ...is criminal but since we are talking about people that society has deem as invaluable this is acceptable. Don’t let this slide. </p><p> I know you all are busy. But can you please do me a favor and contact your State Representative and Senators. </p><p> I know it can be scary to speak truth to power — but you can and you must. We cannot accept that someone sentenced to a two year prison sentence is not only now on 24 hour lock down, but sentenced to death because they are denied early access to the vaccine.</p><p> Those are our brothers, sisters, cousins that are being forgotten about. </p><p> Your reps need to hear from you. Email and call, tell them to follow the science and not allow the personal feeling they have toward to those in prisons and jails cloud their judgment.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AbolishICEDenver/posts/746337882642458">See More</a><a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/find-my-legislator">This website requires javascript to run optimally on computers, mobile devices, and screen readers.

Pike County Prison has eight active cases, bringing the total to 32. Cambria County Jail had 11 total reported cases, though none are active. Clinton County Correctional Facility’s mid-November outbreak has resulted in 55 total cases and 52 active infections among ICE detainees, more current cases than ICE was reporting in any of the other facilities as of Dec. 9.
