Bergen C...ounty Correctional Facility has a new contract with ICE to detain undocumented people in inhumane conditions. In response to this some of the detainees have thrown a hunger strike to demand their immediate release- this hunger strike has lasted over 30 days and nothing has changed regarding the conditions or their release. There is no such thing as “illegal aliens” don’t let the language fool you into demonizing the true natives of this land. Don’t let political terms such as “annexed” or “treaty” fool you into believing that stripping people from their families is legal. The hypocrisy of America to deport people who come to this country for a better life is deadly and shameful.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>
