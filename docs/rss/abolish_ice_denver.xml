He has rejected the science and has relied on his bias, inserting his beliefs and feelings into when and whom have access to the vaccine. He used his authority to change the recommendation. </p><p> We all know someone that is in jail, prison and/or sometime experiencing homelessness. To deny them early access to the vaccine ...is criminal but since we are talking about people that society has deem as invaluable this is acceptable. Don’t let this slide. </p><p> I know you all are busy. But can you please do me a favor and contact your State Representative and Senators. </p><p> I know it can be scary to speak truth to power — but you can and you must. We cannot accept that someone sentenced to a two year prison sentence is not only now on 24 hour lock down, but sentenced to death because they are denied early access to the vaccine.</p><p> Those are our brothers, sisters, cousins that are being forgotten about. </p><p> Your reps need to hear from you. Email and call, tell them to follow the science and not allow the personal feeling they have toward to those in prisons and jails cloud their judgment.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AbolishICEDenver/posts/746337882642458">See More</a><a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/find-my-legislator">This website requires javascript to run optimally on computers, mobile devices, and screen readers.

<br />
&ldquo;The Facility&rdquo; is a short documentary film chronicling the lived experiences of immigrants being held at the GEO detention facility in Aurora, Colorado. This film addresses the personal loss and consequences caused by for-profit detention and the federal government's broken immigration policies. Legal and medical experts highlight horrific abuses including death, medical neglect, nutrition issues, and prolonged detention during the coronavirus pandemic. To tell their stories, current and former detainees, families fighting to be reunited, and advocates come together to share their experiences behind the walls of the GEO immigration detention facility in Aurora.<br />

The only goal of ICE as a state agency is to harm people, instill terror, and wreck lives. The people who make up the ranks of ICE are enemies of humanity, and the long but inevitable arc of justice will judge them accordingly. </p><p> "A common tactic that accompanies this ruse is under public scrutiny once again. This time, in New York where a man who has been a resident of the city for over 30 years was apprehended in October 2020. Agents waited ...outside of his job as a chef in Harlem after his wife was confronted at their home. ICE agents identified themselves to her as police at the couples’ apartment and showed her a photo of another man, not her husband. They led her to believe that there was an honest mix-up and if she helped them identify her husband, she would in effect be resolving the case of mistaken identity. After they received the identifying information that they needed from her which included his cell phone number, the agents arrested Fernando Santos-Rodriguez at the restaurant where he was arriving to begin his morning shift."</p><p> <a href="https://imm-print.com/ice-agents-step-up-deceptive-tactics-to-detain-immigrants/">https://imm-print.com/ice-agents-step-up-deceptive-tactics…/</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AbolishICEDenver/posts/743667286242851">See More</a><a href="https://imm-print.com/ice-agents-step-up-deceptive-tactics-to-detain-immigrants/">Beware: ICE endorses the practice of their agents falsely posing as police officers in order to gain access to homes, spread confusion and apprehend immigrants.<img src="https://external.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQFB9ynLhcdLapQ8&w=540&h=282&url=http%3A%2F%2Fimm-print.com%2Fcontent%2Fimages%2F2020%2F12%2FICEbadge.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQE6qvGUh0y1oDbT" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>imm-print.com</p><p>ICE Agents Step Up Deceptive Tactics To Detain Immigrants</p>Beware: ICE endorses the practice of their agents falsely posing as police officers in order to gain access to homes, spread confusion and apprehend immigrants.<a href="https://imm-print.com/ice-agents-step-up-deceptive-tactics-to-detain-immigrants/">Beware: ICE endorses the practice of their agents falsely posing as police officers in order to gain access to homes, spread confusion and apprehend immigrants.</a>]]></content:encoded>

However, this state repression only fans the People's flames! <br />
<br />
Those in power tried to take away public comment at city council, the DA's still have Elijah classified as a suspect, fascists have burned down his memorial multiple times, the kops took disgusting reenactment photos of Elijah's murder (the only kop fired so far has been fired for taking these depraved photos), a city councilman sicked the far right on us on with the assistance of a local Nazi radio station, the kops helped a bro attempt to run us over on the highway (breaking a woman's leg), the kops tear-gassed us, beat us, and then two DA's put our comrades in jail for 8 days without a bond hearing and are STILL trying to keep them in cages for for up to 40 YEARS. And now Democratic governor @govofco and @philforcolorado -after the Adams and Arapahoe DA's and APD tried to cage the movement-thinks we aren't going to notice the weak ass shit he is pulling with the state investigation during Thanksgiving holiday?!? APD also tried to release body cam footage to the family and media last Thanksgiving thinking people wouldn't notice!<br />
<br />
Democrat politicians always call for &quot;investigations&quot; and &quot;studies&quot; to silence and tire activists and Polis is doing more of the same. Polis knew about Elijah before this summer. Polis knew all along. Let's be real: calling for an investigation into police murder is the Dem Party equivalent of &quot;thoughts and prayers.&quot; <br />
<br />
We will not take down these watered-down concessions from Dems! Elijah's mother wants these cops and paramedics PROSECUTED<br />
<br />
We are watching, we won't stop fighting and we will march and dance and holler until Elijah's mother gets what she asked for--and APD is fucking ABOLISHED<br />

With the recent outbreak, COVID 19 threatens the lives of everyone imprisoned. #DetentionIsDeadly. <br />
<br />
Immigration and Customs Enforcement&rsquo;s decision to return to business as usual and its GEO detention center in Aurora are not keeping our community safe, and experts agree, the only answer is to #FreeThemAll. Just last month, Dr. Carlos Franco Paredes called for compassionate humanitarian release of all imprisoned people.  Join us Monday, November 9th at 6:00 pm at 3130 Oakland in Aurora for a Caravan around the detention center and virtually on FB Live. We will hear from family and impacted individuals and from the Colorado Immigrant Freedom Fund about how your donations can free our people! This event is brought to you by the American Friends Service Committee, the Colorado People&rsquo;s Alliance, the Colorado Freedom Fund AND the Immigrant Freedom Fund of Colorado. <br />

<br />
A BLM protestor was ran over on their scooter this summer wearing a BLM mask in Denver and many in community feel that it's a major DPD coverup. <br />
<br />
Chris was wearing a BLM mask, he tried to get his friends out of harms way and the driver redirected and targeted him, plowing into a group of black kids and killing Chris. All the kids are from out of town and coming back for the DPD press conference Tuesday <br />
<br />
Tomorrow we expect police to say they found the car but no driver and DPD may even be closing the investigation b/c the car was supposedly reported stolen before the incident.]]></content:encoded>
