He has rejected the science and has relied on his bias, inserting his beliefs and feelings into when and whom have access to the vaccine. He used his authority to change the recommendation. </p><p> We all know someone that is in jail, prison and/or sometime experiencing homelessness. To deny them early access to the vaccine ...is criminal but since we are talking about people that society has deem as invaluable this is acceptable. Don’t let this slide. </p><p> I know you all are busy. But can you please do me a favor and contact your State Representative and Senators. </p><p> I know it can be scary to speak truth to power — but you can and you must. We cannot accept that someone sentenced to a two year prison sentence is not only now on 24 hour lock down, but sentenced to death because they are denied early access to the vaccine.</p><p> Those are our brothers, sisters, cousins that are being forgotten about. </p><p> Your reps need to hear from you. Email and call, tell them to follow the science and not allow the personal feeling they have toward to those in prisons and jails cloud their judgment.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AbolishICEDenver/posts/746337882642458">See More</a><a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/find-my-legislator">This website requires javascript to run optimally on computers, mobile devices, and screen readers.

The only goal of ICE as a state agency is to harm people, instill terror, and wreck lives. The people who make up the ranks of ICE are enemies of humanity, and the long but inevitable arc of justice will judge them accordingly. </p><p> "A common tactic that accompanies this ruse is under public scrutiny once again. This time, in New York where a man who has been a resident of the city for over 30 years was apprehended in October 2020. Agents waited ...outside of his job as a chef in Harlem after his wife was confronted at their home. ICE agents identified themselves to her as police at the couples’ apartment and showed her a photo of another man, not her husband. They led her to believe that there was an honest mix-up and if she helped them identify her husband, she would in effect be resolving the case of mistaken identity. After they received the identifying information that they needed from her which included his cell phone number, the agents arrested Fernando Santos-Rodriguez at the restaurant where he was arriving to begin his morning shift."</p><p> <a href="https://imm-print.com/ice-agents-step-up-deceptive-tactics-to-detain-immigrants/">https://imm-print.com/ice-agents-step-up-deceptive-tactics…/</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AbolishICEDenver/posts/743667286242851">See More</a><a href="https://imm-print.com/ice-agents-step-up-deceptive-tactics-to-detain-immigrants/">Beware: ICE endorses the practice of their agents falsely posing as police officers in order to gain access to homes, spread confusion and apprehend immigrants.<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQFB9ynLhcdLapQ8&w=540&h=282&url=http%3A%2F%2Fimm-print.com%2Fcontent%2Fimages%2F2020%2F12%2FICEbadge.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQE6qvGUh0y1oDbT" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>imm-print.com</p><p>ICE Agents Step Up Deceptive Tactics To Detain Immigrants</p>Beware: ICE endorses the practice of their agents falsely posing as police officers in order to gain access to homes, spread confusion and apprehend immigrants.<a href="https://imm-print.com/ice-agents-step-up-deceptive-tactics-to-detain-immigrants/">Beware: ICE endorses the practice of their agents falsely posing as police officers in order to gain access to homes, spread confusion and apprehend immigrants.</a>]]></content:encoded>
