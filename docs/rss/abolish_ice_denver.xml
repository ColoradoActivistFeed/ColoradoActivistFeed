Despite the attempts at co-optation from the Democratic Party and open racism from the Republican Party, youth and workers are still rising up. What lessons can we learn from the uprising last summer to move forward with abolishing the police, breaking with the Democrats, and bringing class struggle together? </p><p> Join us for a panel with Black Socialists who were part of the uprisings in 2020 to reflect o...n the movement last summer, the next steps for the struggle, and what it will take to win true liberation.</p><p> Panelists: </p><p> Tristan Taylor is a leader in the Black-led group Detroit Will Breathe and a member of Left Voice. Tristan led the actions and protests demanding justice for George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. He and dozens of other activists face felony charges for their organizing. </p><p> Darrin Johnson is a leader in the group Black Power Collective. Formerly called Black Lives Matter-Inland Empire, the group recently broke with the BLM Global Network. Darrin is a leader in the fight against police brutality in the Inland Empire. </p><p> Julia Wallace is a frontline worker and leader in SEIU Drop the Cops, a group aiming to kick the police out of unions. She is also a member and international correspondent of Left Voice. </p><p> The purpose of the panel is to engage with fighters in Black, youth, and working-class struggles, reflect on the movement, and, most importantly, how to move forward. International socialist fighters will also be contributing their experiences throughout the discussion."</p><p> The event will be on Feb 27th - 3PM PT/6PM ET. </p><p> To register to receive the zoom link click here:<br /> <a href="https://forms.gle/341AKvjeh77ktyo6A">https://forms.gle/341AKvjeh77ktyo6A</a></p><p> The event will also be live on facebook.</p><p> ----</p><p> To learn more about Left Voice:<br /> <a href="https://www.leftvoice.org/">https://www.leftvoice.org/</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AbolishICEDenver/posts/784040902205489">See More</a><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/150607793_2895918350644227_2011899266390988166_o.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=3&_nc_sid=b386c4&_nc_ohc=7ofeA-GnAuIAX8z8I4b&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=6cc0a8a796ce997ca57be6848cd4f224&oe=605DE582" alt="Left Voice's photo." width="500" height="282" caption="Left Voice's photo." /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2897769553788978/"></a><p>SAT, FEB 27 AT 6:00 PM EST</p><p>Black Socialists on BLM, Class Struggle and Revolution</p>Online Event<i></i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/discovery/">Causes</a> ¬∑ 648 people]]></content:encoded>

On January 6, a group of at least 25 families in Ciudad M√≠er accused GOPES officers of having ‚Äúattacked, robbed and intimidated‚Äù their community. As many as four people were allegedly disappeared and tortured by members of the force.</p><p> On January 13, Mexican congresswoman Olga Juliana Elizondo urged the Tamaulipas State Attorney General‚Äôs Office and the Secretary of Public Security to ‚Äúinvestigate and, where appropriate, sanction the human rights violations committed by the GOPES.‚Äù</p><p> Yet as recently as 2020, GOPES officers received training from US authorities, according to GOPES commander F√©lix Arturo Rodr√≠guez Rodr√≠guez, who was quoted in multiple news reports.

<br />
What better way is there to show solidarity other than showing up, making some noise &amp; closing out this shit show of a year together? Show up with your best NYE noise makers, demonstration banners and signs. Who knows, we may even try out a new flavor of Pig face? Fed or Jeffco anyone?<br />
<br />
We are planning on meeting up at Harriman Lake Park at 7:30 pm at W Quincy Ave &amp; S. Kipling Pkwy, then heading to the facility which is across the street at 9595 W Quincy Ave Littleton, CO  80123.<br />
<br />
**Neither we, nor the other organizers of this action, are affiliated in any way with Eric King nor the Eric King Support team @SupportEricKing. We all just want to show some love and and we are happy to signal boost that!**<br />
<br />
&ldquo;I have been incredibly fortunate to have so many people come into my life and take a stand with me so that I didn&rsquo;t have to face this shit alone&hellip; From the smallest greeting to the big gestures, everything has meant so much to me&hellip; Now that said, I stand by my actions... After seeing what happened in Ferguson, so close down the road, I was disgusted by the lack of mobilization in my city. Three hours away people were fighting for their lives and we weren&rsquo;t even taking to the streets. We were doing nothing. My act as a very personal display of my anger and rage toward the state as well as an act of solidarity to everyone in Ferguson. We never know our own strength until we are tested and even with my ridiculous sentence I feel at least proud to have been able to stand strong and refuse to cooperate with the state. I am just really happy that I don&rsquo;t have to take this alone and have so many amazing people standing next to me. Until all are free.&rdquo;<br />
&mdash; Eric King<br />
