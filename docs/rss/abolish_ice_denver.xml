In July, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals also blocked the rule, but the ruling didn't help any of the thousands of immigrants, like these families, who had already been subjected to the transit ban.</p><p> Under the transit ban policy, those who crossed through a third co...untry, such as Mexico or Guatemala, before arriving at the US southern border were denied asylum during their credible fear interviews, an initial step in the asylum process. After being denied the chance to be screened for asylum, these children and their families were subjected to expedited removal, which allows the government to deport undocumented immigrants without a hearing in front of an immigration judge.Federal courts have said they don't have the authority to weigh in on expedited removals. As a result, judges can't stop the deportation of these families, even though they've found that the policies leading to their deportations are illegal."</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AbolishICEDenver/posts/748847305724849">See More</a><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/adolfoflores/immigrants-deported-without-asylum-heard-properly">"These are refugees who are being sent back to the same situation they fled from," an immigration attorney told BuzzFeed News.<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQGHeK6IULPQbItM&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.buzzfeed.com%2Fbuzzfeed-static%2Fstatic%2F2020-12%2F19%2F1%2Fcampaign_images%2Ff69da90b1e93%2Fimmigrant-families-are-being-deported-without-the-2-2725-1608339884-1_dblbig.jpg%3Fresize%3D1200%3A%2A&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQEV904FDdbj4A7o" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>buzzfeednews.com</p><p>Immigrant Families Are Being Deported Without Their Asylum Claims Heard Lawfully, Advocates Say</p>"These are refugees who are being sent back to the same situation they fled from," an immigration attorney told BuzzFeed News.<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/adolfoflores/immigrants-deported-without-asylum-heard-properly">"These are refugees who are being sent back to the same situation they fled from," an immigration attorney told BuzzFeed News.</a>]]></content:encoded>

Bergen C...ounty Correctional Facility has a new contract with ICE to detain undocumented people in inhumane conditions. In response to this some of the detainees have thrown a hunger strike to demand their immediate release- this hunger strike has lasted over 30 days and nothing has changed regarding the conditions or their release. There is no such thing as “illegal aliens” don’t let the language fool you into demonizing the true natives of this land. Don’t let political terms such as “annexed” or “treaty” fool you into believing that stripping people from their families is legal. The hypocrisy of America to deport people who come to this country for a better life is deadly and shameful.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

He used his authority to change the recommendation. </p><p> We all know someone that is in jail, prison and/or sometime experiencing homelessness. To deny them early access to the vaccine ...is criminal but since we are talking about people that society has deem as invaluable this is acceptable. Don’t let this slide. </p><p> I know you all are busy. But can you please do me a favor and contact your State Representative and Senators. </p><p> I know it can be scary to speak truth to power — but you can and you must.
