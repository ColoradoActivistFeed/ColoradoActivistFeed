Aurora&rsquo;s GEO ICE facility is a private immigrant detention center whose shadowy practices are obscured from advocates and lawmakers alike. But through the stories of those fighting to free their loved ones, and those who have done time on the inside, this film will shine a light on a facility too often shrouded in darkness.<br />
This panel will focus specifically on the healthcare consequences of privatized ICE detention facilities. <br />
<br />
Today, over 400,000 people are booked into ICE custody, a policy of mandatory detention started in 1996 by President Clinton.&nbsp;<br />
​<br />
Running and operating these facilities is GEO Group, a multi-billion dollar&nbsp;Florida-based private prison company with a track record of wage theft, forced labor, false record-keeping, poor oversight and detainee mistreatment.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This film addresses seriously the federal government's ability to detain people, highlighting some of the most common areas of neglect, including&nbsp;medical neglect/abuse, nutrition issues and prolonged detention.&nbsp;<br />
​<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;According to federal government data, GEO Group receives more taxpayer&nbsp;dollars for immigration detention than any other ICE contractor<br />
&nbsp;<br />
So we start at the source to tell this story, with interviews from current and former detainees, families fighting to be reunited, and the experts and advocates&nbsp;trying to save lives while a pandemic rages inside.<br />

<br />
What better way is there to show solidarity other than showing up, making some noise &amp; closing out this shit show of a year together? Show up with your best NYE noise makers, demonstration banners and signs. Who knows, we may even try out a new flavor of Pig face? Fed or Jeffco anyone?<br />
<br />
We are planning on meeting up at Harriman Lake Park at 7:30 pm at W Quincy Ave &amp; S. Kipling Pkwy, then heading to the facility which is across the street at 9595 W Quincy Ave Littleton, CO  80123.<br />
<br />
**Neither we, nor the other organizers of this action, are affiliated in any way with Eric King nor the Eric King Support team @SupportEricKing. We all just want to show some love and and we are happy to signal boost that!**<br />
<br />
&ldquo;I have been incredibly fortunate to have so many people come into my life and take a stand with me so that I didn&rsquo;t have to face this shit alone&hellip; From the smallest greeting to the big gestures, everything has meant so much to me&hellip; Now that said, I stand by my actions... After seeing what happened in Ferguson, so close down the road, I was disgusted by the lack of mobilization in my city. Three hours away people were fighting for their lives and we weren&rsquo;t even taking to the streets. We were doing nothing. My act as a very personal display of my anger and rage toward the state as well as an act of solidarity to everyone in Ferguson. We never know our own strength until we are tested and even with my ridiculous sentence I feel at least proud to have been able to stand strong and refuse to cooperate with the state. I am just really happy that I don&rsquo;t have to take this alone and have so many amazing people standing next to me. Until all are free.&rdquo;<br />
&mdash; Eric King<br />

<br />
However, this obvious state repression only fans the People's flames! <br />
<br />
Those in power tried to take away public comment at city council, the DA's still have Elijah classified as a suspect, fascists have burned down his memorial multiple times, the kops took disgusting reenactment photos of Elijah's murder (the only kop fired so far has been fired for taking these depraved photos), a city councilman sicked the far right on us on with the assistance of a local Nazi radio station, the kops helped a bro attempt to run us over on the highway (breaking a woman's leg), the kops tear-gassed us, beat us, and then two DA's put our comrades in jail for 8 days without a bond hearing and are STILL trying to keep them in cages for for up to 40 YEARS. And now Democratic governor @govofco and @philforcolorado -after the Adams and Arapahoe DA's and APD tried to cage the movement-thinks we aren't going to notice the weak ass shit he is pulling with the state investigation during Thanksgiving holiday?!? APD also tried to release body cam footage to the family and media last Thanksgiving thinking people wouldn't notice!<br />
<br />
Democrat politicians always call for &quot;investigations&quot; and &quot;studies&quot; to silence and tire activists and Polis is doing more of the same. Polis knew about Elijah before this summer. Polis knew all along. Let's be real: calling for an investigation into police murder is the Dem Party equivalent of &quot;thoughts and prayers.&quot; <br />
<br />
We will not take down these watered-down concessions from Dems! Elijah's mother wants these cops and paramedics PROSECUTED<br />
<br />
We are watching, we won't stop fighting and we will march and dance and holler until Elijah's mother gets what she asked for--and APD is fucking ABOLISHED<br />

With the recent outbreak, COVID 19 threatens the lives of everyone imprisoned. #DetentionIsDeadly. <br />
<br />
Immigration and Customs Enforcement&rsquo;s decision to return to business as usual and its GEO detention center in Aurora are not keeping our community safe, and experts agree, the only answer is to #FreeThemAll. Just last month, Dr. Carlos Franco Paredes called for compassionate humanitarian release of all imprisoned people.  Join us Monday, November 9th at 6:00 pm at 3130 Oakland in Aurora for a Caravan around the detention center and virtually on FB Live. We will hear from family and impacted individuals and from the Colorado Immigrant Freedom Fund about how your donations can free our people! This event is brought to you by the American Friends Service Committee, the Colorado People&rsquo;s Alliance, the Colorado Freedom Fund AND the Immigrant Freedom Fund of Colorado. <br />
