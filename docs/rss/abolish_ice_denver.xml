A BLM protestor was ran over on their scooter this summer wearing a BLM mask in Denver and many in community feel that it's a major DPD coverup. <br />
<br />
Chris was wearing a BLM mask, he tried to get his friends out of harms way and the driver redirected and targeted him, plowing into a group of black kids and killing Chris. All the kids are from out of town and coming back for the DPD press conference Tuesday <br />

Tomorrow we expect police to say they found the car but no driver and DPD may even be closing the investigation b/c the car was supposedly reported stolen before the incident.]]></content:encoded>

It is a vile, outlandish, and ...funny-if-it-wasn’t-scary document that details violent fantasies they desperately long to make real.</p><p> One thing this document makes clear: the far right is chomping at the bit to hurt Black Lives Matter protestors.</p><p> They hate the anti-racist rebellion that has gripped this country since cops murdered George Floyd. They hate to see oppressed people fight back. And they hate to see solidarity with the very groups they attempt to scapegoat. </p><p> These white-nationalist, patriot militia-types think cops aren’t repressing the movement violently enough, so they’re volunteering to do more. The Colorado Unorganized Constitutional Militia document, for instance, upholds Kyle Rittenhouse’s double-murder as an example that, “as patriotically awesome as it was to watch, we need to learn from.”</p><p> Right-wing vigilantism attempts to reinforce social inequality and uphold the status quo, not to subvert them. Historically, privatized and vigilante violence has been central to maintaining the racial and social order in the United States. Examples include the KKK, volunteer border patrols, the bosses’ private security forces, and white-on-Black race riots. </p><p> The militia’s violent fantasies transform cities like Denver into war zones. They claim that “not knowing where you are will get you killed,” as if there is danger inherent to urban neighborhoods. Playing to the fears of their mostly white, suburban and exurban, petit-bourgeois membership—the historic social base of fascism—helps motivate them toward violence.</p><p> The ultimate dream of these fascists is for their racist, rapist president to go beyond instructing them to “stand back and stand by” and give them the go-ahead to kidnap and kill protestors. They consider it an imminent possibility and they are actively making plans for that day.</p><p> Some highlights:</p><p> * The militia considers itself at “war with political driven [sic] Marxist groups.” </p><p> * The document is saturated with militaristic buzz words and concepts, like a chain of command and required combat gear.</p><p> * It details rules of engagement for “operating against BLM and Antifa,” which it refers to as “adversaries” and “enemies.”</p><p> * It instructs the militia to “be violent” and “shoot to kill, never to wound,” when they deem it justified via their pseudo-legalistic framework.</p><p> * It details what kinds of weapons to use, including pistols with at least 30 rounds and 9mm capacity, “long guns” in “mobile units,” knives, hard-knuckle gloves, and wasp spray.</p><p> * In addition to instructions to kill protestors, it suggests kidnapping them. For this purpose, militia members are instructed to carry zip ties and a “couple ripped up t-shirts for gags and blind folds.”</p><p> * It uses Trump’s racist phrase “China virus.”</p><p> * The document culminates in a bleak vision that demands the militia’s violent action. It claims the US is “entering into very dark times” when “patriots” are outnumbered and “under attack from Marxist [sic] that aim to destroy everything we have built.”</p><p> * It ends with the white-supremacist, neo-Nazi rallying cry, “Until Valhalla.” That’s an appropriate ending for a self-aggrandizing death cult.</p><p> Here’s the full document: <a href="https://gofile.io/d/dTxESt">https://gofile.io/d/dTxESt</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

Canned and dry foods were collected and hot meals were cooked and served. We also set up tables under canopies to facilitate political conversation, distribute Marxist literature, and invite the people we meet to organize with us to grow the anti-racist, anti-fascist movement. By mid-afternoon all of our goals had been accomplished--most importantly our counter protest had outnumbered, drowned out, and driven off the fascist rally. </p><p> As the ‘patriots’ shuffled off in defeat, a little over an hour after their assembly began, one of them struck, maced, and was subsequently shot and killed by another person. The best information we have is that the shooter was a Pinkerton security contractor employed by 9News, the local NBC affiliate. It has also come out that the person who was killed had violently attacked a Black Lives Matter protestor last summer and was aggressively confronting a Black man moments before the shooting. While we support the right to self-defense and encourage emancipatory collective self-defense independent of the capitalist state by the working class and the oppressed, we believe that our best defense is built with mass organization, not by individual acts of violence. Throughout the history of fascist and far-right organizing, mass movements of oppressed working class people mobilized to oppose them. This has proven to be the most effective, unequivocal and powerful solution. </p><p> Our experience on Saturday bears this out. Without firing a shot, or even connecting with a soup can, we were able to effectively repel the gathering of III%ers, Oath Keepers, Proud Boys, and other white nationalists, while building closer contacts with other workers looking to organize against racism, fascism, and capitalism more broadly. Some media outlets reporting on the event, including the one who employed the alleged shooter, imply that the Denver Communists and others involved in opposing the far-right gathering were responsible for the shooting. This isn’t just incorrect, it inverts the situation entirely--had they been able to assemble without our opposition, the militia-fascists would have felt more empowered to exercise violence, not less. </p><p> The police don’t do anything to stand against fascist violence-- not on Saturday nor this entire summer of mass uprising, not to speak of the historical camaraderie between cops and fascists. We’ve seen them work hand-in-hand with the armed right wing in Kenosha, Portland, and Minneapolis. It’s no different here in Denver where even when the police aren’t directly coordinating with militias and white-nationalist groups they’re always ready to defend them. On Saturday, while we fed the hungry with soup and communist politics, it was no coincidence that the police were facing our rally and kept their backs turned to the armed vigilantes behind them. We can’t rely on the state to oppose reactionary politics. Instead we seek to organize masses of workers to protect ourselves, our communities, and each other.</p><p> If we recognize that our power to combat fascism comes from masses organized against it, that also means that our orientation needs to be to the public. While we acknowledge the importance of security and safeguarding those involved in organizing with us, we believe that many have mistaken obscurity with security. Instead, the Denver Communists are committed to organizing publicly, openly, and confidently. We don’t see any other way to grow the large, combative social movements that are necessary to fight the increasingly deadly status quo. After the success of the BLM-Antifa Soup Drive, we look forward to confronting the far right again the next time they rear their ugly heads. We encourage anyone interested in getting involved to attend our next meeting, over Zoom this Wednesday, where we’ll discuss our approach to organizing against the far right.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

Their civil rights are also being violated with Denver, Adams and Arapahoe County working together to deny our comrades a bond hearing. Our comrades suffer yet they are still thinking of others &mdash; constantly telling communjty about the conditions of their cell mates and others in the jail and agitating for their release as well. @justiceforelijahmcclain PSL Denver and Say Their Names 5280 are heroes and freedom fighters.

In a SINGLE DAY A quarter million dollars were paid out to APD and Adams County officers just to try to intimidate us with fences and riot gear. That day, APD also tried to make our indigenous comrades drop their prayer sticks to enter on Oakland Street and when our comrades told APD, &quot;You're in riot gear and have batons! Let us have our prayer sticks or we are gonna sue the shit out of you!&quot; <br />
<br />
Why does APD continue to do private security for Aurora GEO? La policia, la migra, misma porqueria!<br />

Mariposa at the Althea Center, in partnership with NY-based Immigration Equality and American Friends Service Committee Colorado, will present &ldquo;Immigration is an LGBTQ Issue: Love Across Borders,&rdquo; 4-week series of programs highlighting some of the traumatizing circumstances and critical needs of our LGBTQ sisters and brothers seeking asylum in the United States.<br />
 <br />
With simultaneous Spanish/English interpretation provided for Zoom participants, we will hear powerful and personal migration stories from current and recent LGBTQ asylum seekers. PFLAG Las Cruces, NM, will share their &ldquo;real life&rdquo; model of hosting asylum seekers, for which they won an award last year from the national PFLAG organization. We will hear from national and local leaders doing the day-to-day work of assisting and supporting these asylum seekers. <br />

On Wednesday, Sept 9, they shot and killed Antonio Blackbear, a 41-year-old Lakota man.<br />
<br />
Antonio was the adopted cousin of another Lakota man killed by the Denver Police five years ago, Paul Castaway. Indigenous people are more likely than any other racial group to be killed by police. <br />
<br />
There has been no semblance of justice for Paul in that time, since Denver District Attorneys, like their counterparts around the nation, refuse to hold police accountable for the violent, racist terror that forms the very core of their job description. We expect the fight for justice for Antonio to be a similarly difficult one.<br />
<br />
The police have yet to release video of their killing of Antonio, nor say much about it, because they are working to craft a story that casts them in the best light.<br />
<br />
Justice for Antonio Blackbear!<br />
Defund, disarm, and disband the police!]]></content:encoded>
