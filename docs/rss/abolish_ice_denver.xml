This was after Aurora District Attorney Dave Young declined to file any charges against the killers, then the city of Aurora opened a sham investigation led by a former cop which was terminated because it was plainly not “independent”.... Now it is up to Phil Weiser to decide whether the cops and paramedics responsible for Elijah’s death will face any criminal charges.</p><p> But just this week, Governor Polis quietly loosened the scope of the investigation, allowing Weiser to investigate for “offenses”, not just “criminal activity” related to Elijah’s death, opening up the possibility for him to come back with watered down charges against the killers, like we saw in Breonna Taylor’s case. Polis also took out the words that suggest someone caused the death of Elijah McClain.</p><p> Polis must think that the movement isn’t paying attention, that we’ve been subdued by the repressive arrests of movement leaders, and now he can reel back his investigation without opposition in the streets.

To the casual observer, the prospect of President-elect Joe Biden—who promised to “stop corporations from profiteering from incarceration”—presented an existential threat to the multi-billion dollar industry.This article was published in partnership with Slate.But the big players in private prisons, CoreCivic and Geo Group, are not pan...icking—and rumors of their impending demise have been exaggerated. That’s because they’ve been steadily diversifying, placing their bets on a future that includes revenue from commercial real estate, electronic monitoring, and halfway houses.</p><p> On a quarterly earnings call just two days after the election, CoreCivic CEO Damon Hininger was asked about the possibility that a Biden administration may end the company’s contracts with the federal Bureau of Prisons. He replied confidently, “We think our risk is pretty minimal there.” He noted that back in 2010, the agency accounted for 15 percent of the company’s revenue. Today it’s just 2 percent.The companies still care which party controls the government: A Newsweek analysis of political contributions from GEO and CoreCivic’s political action committees found that both heavily favored Republicans in political donations during the 2020 cycle. About 95 percent of GEO’s nearly $1 million in donations went to GOP candidates and the party, as did more than 87 percent of CoreCivic’s $181,000."</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AbolishICEDenver/posts/729229004353346">See More</a><a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/11/17/think-private-prison-companies-are-going-away-under-biden-they-have-other-plans">CoreCivic and GEO Group have been shifting away from prisons toward other government contracts, like office space and immigration detention.<img src="https://external.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQAT-CLHEnG0hucQ&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fd1n0c1ufntxbvh.cloudfront.net%2Fphoto%2Fa7711d9f%2F62718%2F1200x%2F&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQBOVt3fWXos_cUv" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>themarshallproject.org</p><p>Think Private Prison Companies Are Going Away Under Biden?

This was after Aurora District Attorney Dave Young declined to file any charges against the killers, then the city of Aurora opened a sham investigation led by a former cop which was terminated because it was plainly not “independent”.... Now it is up to Phil Weiser to decide whether the cops and paramedics responsible for Elijah’s death will face any criminal charges.</p><p> But just this week, Governor Polis quietly loosened the scope of the investigation, allowing Weiser to investigate for “offenses”, not just “criminal activity” related to Elijah’s death, opening up the possibility for him to come back with watered down charges against the killers, like we saw in Breonna Taylor’s case. Polis also took out the words that suggest someone caused the death of Elijah McClain.</p><p> Polis must think that the movement isn’t paying attention, that we’ve been subdued by the repressive arrests of movement leaders, and now he can reel back his investigation without opposition in the streets. He is wrong.</p><p> Join us for an emergency action to make it clear that we are still here and we are not going anywhere until we get justice for Elijah McClain!</p><p> MASKS REQUIRED (OVER YOUR NOSE & MOUTH!) & PLEASE KEEP DISTANCE BETWEEN YOURSELF AND OTHERS.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AbolishICEDenver/posts/725862328023347">See More</a><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s526x296/125278763_1081285375657285_3437983229966432355_o.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=2&_nc_sid=b386c4&_nc_ohc=JTDTXCrSvYQAX-YNh_C&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=7&oh=4606d678bc017eff16e7a88befbe3785&oe=5FDE866B" alt="Party for Socialism and Liberation - Denver's photo." width="504" height="263" caption="Party for Socialism and Liberation - Denver's photo." /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2411035489021262/"></a><p>SAT, NOV 21</p><p>EMERGENCY ACTION: Eyes on Weiser!

Their civil rights are also being violated with Denver, Adams and Arapahoe County working together to deny our comrades a bond hearing. Our comrades suffer yet they are still thinking of others &mdash; constantly telling communjty about the conditions of their cell mates and others in the jail and agitating for their release as well. @justiceforelijahmcclain PSL Denver and Say Their Names 5280 are heroes and freedom fighters. And we need to be fighting harder than ever for them.  See you Saturday!]]></content:encoded>
