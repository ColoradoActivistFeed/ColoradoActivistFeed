<br />
Aurora&rsquo;s GEO ICE facility is a private immigrant detention center whose shadowy practices are obscured from advocates and lawmakers alike. But through the stories of those fighting to free their loved ones, and those who have done time on the inside, this film will shine a light on a facility too often shrouded in darkness.<br />
This panel will focus specifically on the healthcare consequences of privatized ICE detention facilities. <br />
<br />
Today, over 400,000 people are booked into ICE custody, a policy of mandatory detention started in 1996 by President Clinton.&nbsp;<br />
​<br />
Running and operating these facilities is GEO Group, a multi-billion dollar&nbsp;Florida-based private prison company with a track record of wage theft, forced labor, false record-keeping, poor oversight and detainee mistreatment.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This film addresses seriously the federal government's ability to detain people, highlighting some of the most common areas of neglect, including&nbsp;medical neglect/abuse, nutrition issues and prolonged detention.&nbsp;<br />
​<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;According to federal government data, GEO Group receives more taxpayer&nbsp;dollars for immigration detention than any other ICE contractor<br />
&nbsp;<br />
So we start at the source to tell this story, with interviews from current and former detainees, families fighting to be reunited, and the experts and advocates&nbsp;trying to save lives while a pandemic rages inside.<br />

<br />
What better way is there to show solidarity other than showing up, making some noise &amp; closing out this shit show of a year together? Show up with your best NYE noise makers, demonstration banners and signs. Who knows, we may even try out a new flavor of Pig face? Fed or Jeffco anyone?<br />
<br />
We are planning on meeting up at Harriman Lake Park at 7:30 pm at W Quincy Ave &amp; S. Kipling Pkwy, then heading to the facility which is across the street at 9595 W Quincy Ave Littleton, CO  80123.<br />
<br />
**Neither we, nor the other organizers of this action, are affiliated in any way with Eric King nor the Eric King Support team @SupportEricKing. We all just want to show some love and and we are happy to signal boost that!**<br />
<br />
&ldquo;I have been incredibly fortunate to have so many people come into my life and take a stand with me so that I didn&rsquo;t have to face this shit alone&hellip; From the smallest greeting to the big gestures, everything has meant so much to me&hellip; Now that said, I stand by my actions... After seeing what happened in Ferguson, so close down the road, I was disgusted by the lack of mobilization in my city. Three hours away people were fighting for their lives and we weren&rsquo;t even taking to the streets. We were doing nothing. My act as a very personal display of my anger and rage toward the state as well as an act of solidarity to everyone in Ferguson. We never know our own strength until we are tested and even with my ridiculous sentence I feel at least proud to have been able to stand strong and refuse to cooperate with the state. I am just really happy that I don&rsquo;t have to take this alone and have so many amazing people standing next to me. Until all are free.&rdquo;<br />
&mdash; Eric King<br />
