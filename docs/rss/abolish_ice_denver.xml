We will hear from national and local leaders doing the day-to-day work of assisting and supporting these asylum seekers. <br />

On Wednesday, Sept 9, they shot and killed Antonio Blackbear, a 41-year-old Lakota man.<br />
<br />
Antonio was the adopted cousin of another Lakota man killed by the Denver Police five years ago, Paul Castaway. Indigenous people are more likely than any other racial group to be killed by police. <br />
<br />
There has been no semblance of justice for Paul in that time, since Denver District Attorneys, like their counterparts around the nation, refuse to hold police accountable for the violent, racist terror that forms the very core of their job description. We expect the fight for justice for Antonio to be a similarly difficult one.<br />
<br />
The police have yet to release video of their killing of Antonio, nor say much about it, because they are working to craft a story that casts them in the best light.<br />
<br />
Justice for Antonio Blackbear!<br />
Defund, disarm, and disband the police!]]></content:encoded>

As you may know, Sza Sza Codner or Jennifer Codner is a Jamaican trans woman detained at Aurora Contract Detention Facility.<br />
<br />
Sza Sza endured violence and persecution in her country of origin which drove her to seek asylum and refuge here. Since then she's been ferried from one immigrant prison to the other, subjected to solitary confinement, targeting and harassment from guards, placed in men's facilities, and a host of other horrible atrocities.<br />
Help end her indefinite imprisonment by pushing for her release.<br />
<br />
Sza Sza has court this Friday, 9/11 and we are determined to assist in getting her out of detention and towards safety.]]></content:encoded>

<br />
Many of us in the Coalition to Close the Concentation Camps knew that it was time to take action against forces of fascism and evil- especially for our families impacted by this broken immigration system.  On July 12, 2019, radicals and impacted families split from the milquetoast Lights for Liberty vigil being conducted at the Aurora ICE Processing Center. Rebels marched  into the parking lot of GEO- where anticolonial speeches were given by indigenous youth and where the now infamous flag removal occurred. <br />
<br />
Following the flag removal and international embarrassment, the Aurora Police Department began a Twitter manhunt offering a $4k reward to identify suspects from that evening; violent crimes typically only get a $1k reward and we knew this outrageously large reward was made because two anti police flags were flown that night. Cowards at APD wouldn't fire or prosecute the murderers of Elijah McClain the following month, yet APD had the time and resources to target non-violent protestors demanding justice for immigrants.<br />
<br />
The woman featured in this powerful photo, Michelle, was eventually identified by non profit &quot;allies&quot; and served misdemeanor tampering charges; Michelle's case with Aurora dragged on for over a year. Today we have some good news: our hero was found NOT GUILTY by jury trial and walks free of all charges! Fuck APD!<br />
<br />
Michelle- you are an inspiration and a true Chingona. With you, our city sent a message to the Department of Homeland Security.  Your bravery, in addition to the life Willem Van Spronsen gave on July 13th 2019 by setting ICE's kidnapping vans in Tacoma ablaze, made ICE retreat on their planned nationwide mass arrests of immigrants.<br />

They have the authority to transfer us immediately if we want,&quot; says Jimmy Sodhi, a 45-year-old ICE detainee.<br />
<br />
Sodhi is part of a group of eight ICE detainees who have been housed in the same dormitory at the Teller County Jail since being transferred there from the Aurora Contract Detention Facility one month ago. Sodhi and the other ICE detainees began the hunger strike on the morning of August 10 to protest what they allege are significantly worse conditions at Aurora GEO.<br />
<br />
&quot;As a Sikh, I'm not allowed to wear my Sikh bracelet, I'm not allowed to cover my head. If I have to pray, it's required for me to cover my head. I'm told to cover my head with a pillowcase or a towel,&quot; says Sodhi, who has been in ICE custody since March 2017 and is currently in the appeals process of his deportation case stemming from a fraud conviction for insider trading. &quot;That is very demeaning, very disrespectful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sodhi notes that he was allowed to wear his turban at the Aurora detention facility, but has been told by staff at the Teller County Jail that he cannot retrieve his turban from his personal belongings. Same with prayer books, Sodhi adds, which he hasn't been able to obtain, being told by staff that &quot;there's no chaplain here and we don't have those here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Additionally, Sodhi contends that he and other ICE detainees at the Teller County Jail have been subjected to racial harassment perpetrated by non-ICE detainees staying in the same dormitory.<br />
<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
Adding to his angst, Sodhi contends that he and the other detainees don't even know why they're being housed in the Teller County Jail, which has an agreement with ICE to house immigrant detainees.<br />
