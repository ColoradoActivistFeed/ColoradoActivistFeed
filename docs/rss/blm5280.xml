Jorge has lived in the U.S. for 21 years. He grew up and attended school in Denver, and this is where he formed his family. Practically his entire direct family is in Colorado, including his parents, siblings, and his four children, who need him here with them. It would be a huge loss for his four children to not have their father. The youngest child is four years old, and needs his father. </p><p> On September 18 Jorge’s lawyers abandoned his case and now he urgently needs to find legal representation. The legal costs are very high, and so he’s hoping to activate the community asking the community for solidarity as it is urgent for him to have legal representation. Being in sanctuary, it’s difficult to save up $5,000 on work alone. So he’s asking the community to help keep this father with his four children. They are young, and need him here with them. Jorge is doing everything he can to raise the money through his business detailing cars and doing freelance graphic design. However, it’s not enough to provide for his family and his legal costs. Moreover, he was taken by surprise at his legal team’s decision to abandon the case. Help provide him legal counsel so that he can continue fighting his case and stay with his family.</p><p> Jorge’s new lawyer will start with a deep investigation of his legal case, and she needs $2500 to begin. After that we’ll have an estimate of the full legal costs. Right now costs are estimated at $18,000. We’ll update the page once we know that full costs for sure.<br /> <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/keep-jorge-with-his-family">https://www.gofundme.com/f/keep-jorge-with-his-family</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackLivesMatter5280/posts/2701270393523510">See More</a><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/keep-jorge-with-his-family">Jorge Araiza has been in sanctuary resisting deportation since December of 2019.

We have shared and will continue to share links to bail/legal support fundraising in Denver, Minneapolis and beyond. We encourage friends to donate to BLM5280’s Emergency Fund using Venmo <a href="http://venmo.com/BLM5280">http://venmo.com/BLM5280</a> . These donations will be used for bail, legal support, and provision of direct services for Black people impacted by the current and ongoing crisis.
