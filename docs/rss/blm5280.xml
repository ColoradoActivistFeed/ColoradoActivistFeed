We ask that you strongly consider checking in on your unhoused neighbors the next couple days. Perhaps bring folx ...hot tea/coffee/cocao, handwarmers, socks, etc. With the right gear, folx can be warm and safe. With the right shelter/tent set-up, folx can survive. Here is some advice if you've never gone over to a tent community: they are humans just like you! Show solidarity by asking how folx are, what they may need or what would be helpful--either supplies or actions. Also remember: many of the people living outside (even during 10 degree weather) are intentionally choosing that over staying in a shelter. There are many reasons why folx don't feel safe or comfortable inside shelters, so please aid folx in surviving where they are at. Lastly, because of all the sweeps in the last couple months, lots of tents, tarps, blankets, etc., have been thrown away by the city, so while you're brewing fresh coffee to put in a carafe, maybe also consider emailing or calling the mayor and telling him to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/stopthesweeps">#STOPTHESWEEPS</a>! The Department of Transportation and Infrastructure needs to hear it, too! Also the Department of Public Health and Environment! <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/righttosurvive">#RIGHTTOSURVIVE</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

Disney is a part of the ABC Network Family. The same ABC that has benefitted from Shonda’s storytelling genius and houses several of her shows. <br /> An executive at the theme park responded to her request with “Don’t you have enough”?</p><p> Don’t you have enough?</p><p> The ongoing statement that Black women hear in all aspects of their lives when we request our due</p><p> Don’t we have enough?<br /> When we insist that gender-based movements must incorporate how gender-based discrimination and violence shows up differently for Black Women<br /> We are asked<br /> Isn’t it enough to focus on our shared oppression of gender?</p><p> When we point out that how we navigate the world in Black skin is impacted by our gender and adds its own dangers including <br /> The minimization of police brutality on us<br /> The insistence that we not hold those accountable for harming us if they look like us<br /> The dismissal of the murdering of our Trans-sisters<br /> We are asked<br /> Isn’t it enough to talk about Black Lives and not let your gender “separate us?”</p><p> When we point out that we are expected to work harder, longer, and for less pay than our white counterparts of any gender<br /> And are weighed down under the pressure of knowing that we are expected to represent “All” of us<br /> We are asked<br /> Isn’t it enough that you are in the room?</p><p> When we tell those in our lives that we will not settle for Struggle Love, but want those who support us, stimulate our minds, and value Black Women<br /> We are asked<br /> Isn’t it enough to have ….someone?</p><p> In times when we say that we are tired, that we need spaces to be vulnerable that are filled with other Black Women who understand our unique intersectional struggle<br /> We are asked<br /> Isn’t  your Black Girl Magic…enough?</p><p> The world views us as those who carry its burdens, because as Zora summarized “The Black woman is the mule of the world.”<br /> Who can be counted on to consider the needs of all others (sometimes to the detriments of ourselves) because as Anna Julia Cooper stated ““when and where I enter, in the quiet, undisputed dignity of my womanhood, without violence and without suing or special patronage, then and there the whole Negro race enters with me.”<br /> And we know that her sentiment goes even beyond Black people<br /> The world depends on Black women</p><p> So, when we begin to expect more<br /> When we begin to realize we deserve more<br /> The world pushes back</p><p> It insists that we need to remain in the place that is comfortable for it<br /> We are gaslighted with the language of “You have enough”<br /> When we have proven ourselves worthy of so much more<br /> And just like Shonda Rhimes demonstrated in her “taking her talents to Netflix”, </p><p> We as Black women must never believe it is enough<br /> Because the world owes a debt to us that it can never fully pay</p><p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/shondarhimes">#ShondaRhimes</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/netflix">#Netflix</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/blackwomen">#BlackWomen</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/zoranealehurston">#ZoraNealeHurston</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/annajuliacooper">#AnnaJuliaCooper</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/centeringsisters">#CenteringSisters</a> </p><p> Dr. Dent is a licensed psychologist. Her hardest job is being a Black Woman who centers the experiences of Black women and girls. Daily, she reminds herself that, although she is “Enough”, the world has not given her “enough”.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

There has been close collaboration between residents of the encampment and library staff. Until the last few weeks, the number of encampment residents was kept around 15 or 20 so as to fit in the best space available next to the library. But after recent sweeps of multiple encampments from nearby areas, this Blair-caldwell encampment naturally grew as others had nowhere to go. Now there are at least 50 people living here...and they are being told to scatter scram. </p><p>  </p><p> This is also the same site that was recently proposed for a Safe Outdoor Site that the Mayor originally approved and then pulled his support last minute after a Business Improvement District spoke against it. A vision of what it could look like to have this very site be a living space for around 40 people has already been shown and approved by City departments like fire, water, and DDPHE, and yet, just because the Mayor cares more about business interests than people’s lives, this is not happening and all these people living here will be scattered to no where. </p><p>  </p><p> Residents of this encampment include many elderly disabled people, young people who work full time jobs, people who can’t go to shelters due to previous abuse by other guests, people who have lived on the streets for years sitting on housing wait lists, and more.  </p><p>  </p><p> This is the third sweep scheduled for this week - in spite of the cold and snow. </p><p>  </p><p> This insanity and inhumanity must end. </p><p>  </p><p> Please come and support our unhoused community members at Blair-Caldwell Library as they demand real housing or places where they are allowed to survive - while being forced to nowhere by the City.</p><p>  </p><p> Bring the following things to assist residents:</p><p> -Truck, or any vehicle to help move</p><p> -Carts</p><p> -Bungee Cords</p><p> -Rope</p><p> -Trash Bags</p><p> -Food</p><p> -Coffee/CoCo</p><p> -Water</p><p> Your assistance is much appreciated!

We have some exciting news to lead into the weekend.<br /> We are pleased to announce the Ravens as the new mascot for... South High School.</p><p> The South High School mascot has been the Rebels since the school’s founding in 1926. The Rebels is a reference to the southern Confederacy in the Civil War. Nearly 100 years after the school’s founding, the Rebels no longer seems appropriate, acceptable, or an accurate representation of what South stands for or should reflect in its mascot. For this reason, the leadership at South determined that the mascot should be updated to better represent the school’s values.</p><p> Over the past six months, South leadership completed the following research tactics to get a pulse on community input for the new mascot.</p><p> Focus groups with athletes and coaches, PTSA, board members and staff members.<br /> Online surveys of students, parents, community members, alumni, faculty and staff resulting in nearly 1,000 responses.<br /> Development of a mascot selection committee consisting of Denver City Council Representative, Musical Art Sponsors, Athletic Coaches, Alumni Board members, PTSA Board members, Student Body Co-Presidents, Student Athletic Leadership Team Representatives, Student Board of Education Representative, teachers, and Current Building Administration.</p><p> As a result of this robust community feedback, the Ravens were selected as our new mascot. We believe that the Ravens represent the South community in a number of ways. Ravens are smart, clever birds that are known to be strategic problem solvers. They are empathetic, loyal creatures that form lifelong bonds. And importantly, the raven is an inclusive animal -- it has a long history of being held in high regard both in Native American culture and others throughout the world, and ravens are not associated with any particular gender or race.</p><p> We appreciate all the dedication to this process from our community and we look forward to presenting our new logo in the coming weeks. Go Ravens!</p><p> Sincerely,<br /> Bobby Thomas<br /> Principal, South High School<br /> We are Denver South<br /> Home of the “Ravens”</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

Jorge has lived in the U.S. for 21 years. He grew up and attended school in Denver, and this is where he formed his family. Practically his entire direct family is in Colorado, including his parents, siblings, and his four children, who need him here with them. It would be a huge loss for his four children to not have their father. The youngest child is four years old, and needs his father. </p><p> On September 18 Jorge’s lawyers abandoned his case and now he urgently needs to find legal representation. The legal costs are very high, and so he’s hoping to activate the community asking the community for solidarity as it is urgent for him to have legal representation. Being in sanctuary, it’s difficult to save up $5,000 on work alone. So he’s asking the community to help keep this father with his four children. They are young, and need him here with them. Jorge is doing everything he can to raise the money through his business detailing cars and doing freelance graphic design. However, it’s not enough to provide for his family and his legal costs. Moreover, he was taken by surprise at his legal team’s decision to abandon the case. Help provide him legal counsel so that he can continue fighting his case and stay with his family.</p><p> Jorge’s new lawyer will start with a deep investigation of his legal case, and she needs $2500 to begin. After that we’ll have an estimate of the full legal costs. Right now costs are estimated at $18,000. We’ll update the page once we know that full costs for sure.<br /> <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/keep-jorge-with-his-family">https://www.gofundme.com/f/keep-jorge-with-his-family</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackLivesMatter5280/posts/2701270393523510">See More</a><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/keep-jorge-with-his-family">Jorge Araiza has been in sanctuary resisting deportation since December of 2019.

We have shared and will continue to share links to bail/legal support fundraising in Denver, Minneapolis and beyond. We encourage friends to donate to BLM5280’s Emergency Fund using Venmo <a href="http://venmo.com/BLM5280">http://venmo.com/BLM5280</a> . These donations will be used for bail, legal support, and provision of direct services for Black people impacted by the current and ongoing crisis.
