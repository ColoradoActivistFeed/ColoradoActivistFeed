Brown: "Toxic masculinity is real and it’s dangerous. Like white supremacy, it’s not the fish in the tank but the water around them. Toxic masculinity can bleed into movements in very dangerous ways. I’ve experienced that and that’s why there is a BLM 5280, because of the ways the patriarchy and white supremacy made Black women and the queer community feel unsafe in activist spaces. </p><p> I can only speak for Black women. I can’t speak for my Indigenous, Latinx, and Asian s...isters. But Black women sit at this intersection of white supremacy and heteronormative patriarchy. Anything that hits a black man once is going to hit us twice. Anything that hits a white woman once is going to hit us five times because we’re doubly impacted. A white friend of mine told me she wished Black people didn’t have to do any of this and I should be able to be at home enjoying my life. But my life depends on this work and we can’t leave these movements for other people to lead. Historically, when we’ve left being in charge to cis-hetero men or allies it’s turned into a dumpster fire that has often been harmful. It’s our lives that depend on this work and women are impacted by every change that is and isn’t made."</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackLivesMatter5280/posts/2814812782169270">See More</a><a href="https://www.msmayhem.com/the-women-leading-social-justice-movements/">Research shows that women are better equipped to lead social justice movements.

In February he was hospitalized and almost lost his leg due to a bone infection. Now, he’s home but needs daily care to support him as he navigates life in a wheelchair until we are able to fully heal his feet & legs. I’ve been able to hire a care giver to come daily but need support to help pay for it.

A cluster of misinformation, a few historical truths, and sensational media.</p><p> 2. A propaganda film that will ultimately lead our folks to double down on their homophobia instead of unpacking historic and present sexual violence on Black Men and reimagining how we address sexual violence.</p><p> 3. Another reason to traumatize viewers</p><p> Instead, if folks are serious in learning about the ways we were dehumanized in hopes of creating new ways of being and healing, i would recommend "Delectable Negro by Vincent Woodard.</p><p> P.S. Even if this book is referenced in the doc, it doesn't matter.
