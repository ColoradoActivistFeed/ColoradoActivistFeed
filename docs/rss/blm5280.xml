A communist, civil rights organiser and the third woman to feature on the FBI...'s most wanted list, for a time Davis was also closely associated with the Black Panther Party. <br /> Davis worked at University of California at Los Angeles until being fired for her political views on the orders of governor Ronald Reagan. Soon after, Davis was arrested following the Marin county courthouse incident on bogus charges of murder, kidnapping and conspiracy of which she was later all acquitted at trial.<br /> Davis has also been a consistent advocate of feminism which takes into account factors like race, class, capitalism and transgender rights, and highlights the vital historical contributions of Black women: "When we speak of feminism in this country, there almost always is the tendency to assume that this is something that was created by white women… Women like Ida B. Wells, women like Mary Church Terrell, women like Anna Julia Cooper, are responsible for the feminist approach today that we generally call intersectionality… What I want to argue is for a feminist perspective that understands that we cannot simply reform institutions like prison and the police, because they are so embedded with racism and violence that, if we're ever going to extricate ourselves from that, we have to abolish prisons".<br /> In this collection of Davis's writings, including contributions from others like James Baldwin and Huey P Newton, Davis tells the story of her trial and incarceration, as well as the prison system in the United States in general: <a href="https://shop.workingclasshistory.com/collections/books/products/if-they-come-in-the-morning-angela-davis">https://shop.workingclasshistory.com/…/if-they-come-in-the-…</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

A city as diverse as Aurora must be a safe place for everyone, regardless of their race or immigration status. Aurora City Council and Mayor Coffman have he opportunity to take meaningful steps to reinvest in our community and protect ALL Auror...a Residents.</p><p> Join us on Monday January 11th 6:30pm to watch Aurora City Council Vote on the Safer Aurora and Immigrant Legal Defense Fund Ordinances.</p><p> Have your voice heard!! Share your testimony for both ordinances on Monday:</p><p> 1. Call the live public comment line at 855.695.3475 and once connected press *3 to reach the operator.</p><p> 2. The operator will ask which item the caller would like to speak on and place you in the queue for that item.</p><p> 3. The public comment call-in line will open at 6:00 p.m. the day of the Council Meeting.</p><p> Send a loud and clear message to Aurora City Council Members and Mayor Coffman and let them know that immigrants are WELCOME in Aurora! Ask them to vote YES on the Safer Aurora Ordinance and immigrant Legal Defense Fund.  </p><p> Join our movement! <a href="https://linktr.ee/COPApower">https://linktr.ee/COPApower</a></p><p> ***<br /> ¡Los ataques a nuestra comunidad de inmigrantes continuarán mientras no estén protegidos en nuestras ciudades!</p><p> Es más probable que los inmigrantes negros sean criminalizados por el sistema policial o mueran a manos de las fuerzas del orden. Una ciudad tan diversa como Aurora debe ser un lugar seguro para todos, independientemente de su raza o estado migratorio. El Concejo Municipal de Aurora y el Alcalde Coffman tienen la oportunidad de tomar medidas significativas para reinvertir en nuestra comunidad y proteger a TODOS los residentes de Aurora.</p><p> Únase a nosotros el lunes 11 de Enero a las 6:30 pm para ver la votación del Concejo Municipal de Aurora sobre las ordenanzas del Fondo de Defensa Legal para Inmigrantes y Aurora Más Segura.</p><p> ¡Haz que se escuche tu voz! Comparta su testimonio de ambas ordenanzas el lunes:</p><p> 1. Llame a la línea de comentarios públicos en vivo al 855.695.3475 y una vez conectado presione * 3 para comunicarse con el operador.</p><p> 2. El operador preguntará sobre qué elemento llama, tomara su nombre y la colocara en la linea.</p><p> 3. La línea telefónica para comentarios públicos se abrirá a las 6::30 p.m. el día de la reunión del Consejo.</p><p> Envíe un mensaje alto y claro a los miembros del Concejo Municipal de Aurora y al alcalde Coffman y hágales saber que los inmigrantes son BIENVENIDOS en Aurora.

Sunday January 24th!<br /> We'll have a naturopathic doctor talking about  Prioritizing Your Health in 2021. We'll have a financial expert sharing a Mindful Approach to Financial Wellness. I'll be teaching about how to lever...age breathwork techniques at work. There will be a beautiful restorative yoga class, and we'll end with a cardology reading for the year; cardology predates tarot cards and combines astrology, the planets and more to make in depth predictions for our lives.  Let's get this year started right!  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/blackwomen">#blackwomen</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/blackwomenshealth">#blackwomenshealth</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/blackwomenwellness">#blackwomenwellness</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/latinwomen">#latinwomen</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/bipocwomen">#bipocwomen</a>"</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackLivesMatter5280/posts/2775415129442369">See More</a><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/black-and-brown-womens-wellness-summit-reclaiming-our-well-being-tickets-136236909263">Start the new year with a mindful approach to all areas of life, from mental and physical health, to professional and financial wellness!<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQGmguEwpFSYxCSp&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.evbuc.com%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.evbuc.com%252Fimages%252F122749123%252F132662749962%252F1%252Foriginal.20210111-043202%3Fw%3D1000%26auto%3Dformat%252Ccompress%26q%3D75%26sharp%3D10%26rect%3D0%252C78%252C1920%252C960%26s%3D5c544d9a6efd1e21d9cc975c4546673c&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQFXGsgy1PfcAOEQ" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>eventbrite.com</p><p>Black and Brown Women's Wellness Summit: Reclaiming Our Well-being</p>Start the new year with a mindful approach to all areas of life, from mental and physical health, to professional and financial wellness!<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/black-and-brown-womens-wellness-summit-reclaiming-our-well-being-tickets-136236909263">Start the new year with a mindful approach to all areas of life, from mental and physical health, to professional and financial wellness!</a>]]></content:encoded>
