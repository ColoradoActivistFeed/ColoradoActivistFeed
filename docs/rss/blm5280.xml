As I have grown, and looked into myself, I have come to take responsibility for the choices I made. Once I accepted the harm my role caused others, I actively sought out ways that I could make amends.”</p><p> — Ronald Johnson </p><p> Ronald Johnson is pre-diabetic, suffers from asthma and high blood pressure, and regularly uses an inhaler to breathe. His age and respiratory ailments put him at risk of serious illness and death if he contracts COVID-19. With over hundreds of active cases in Colorado’s prisons, his family fears he will not make it out alive. His daughter, Amber, says, “In prison, he can’t protect himself and he can’t social distance. My deep fear is that my dad will die in prison. That is an awful, traumatic reality to consider. My chest is tight just thinking about how quickly it spreads and how vulnerable he is.”</p><p> Ronald has served 22 years in prison for theft, forgery, fraud and drug possession, and he takes full responsibility for his actions. Amber has seen how her father has changed. She recalls when she was 18, headed to college and heard her father was sentenced to 96 years in prison. She says, “I did not have a lot of respect for him when he was first sentenced. I told him I was so disappointed that his careless actions were going to cause so much suffering for his family. Since I said that, he made a change. He has been sober 15 years and I have witnessed the transformation. Now, I have a dad. I have someone I respect and love. He is a model in the prison, and he will better our community when he is free.”</p><p> Ronald has spent decades devoting himself to self-improvement and supporting other incarcerated people. He is an Offender Care Aide who assists incarcerated people with medical disabilities, mentors incarcerated people earning their GED and coordinates the mental health course offered to incarcerated people. He has completed numerous job trainings, courses and programs including Bridges to Life and Thinking for a Change. Ronald has spent over ten years in an incentive unit, which requires him to avoid disciplinary infractions, where he assists staff with maintenance of the facility. He says, “Ten years ago, I never would have believed I would be working with, and alongside, correctional staff. Just as times change, so do people and so have I.”</p><p> Governor Hickenlooper shortened his sentence following testimony from family, friends and correctional officers advocating for his early release. Yet, he is still eight years away from parole. While he remains in prison, COVID-19 continues to spread. Ronald’s three siblings, four children and four grandchildren are desperate for his release. Amber says, “When people say “Black Lives Matter”, they mean that our lives are not dispensable. My dad was sentenced to 96 years in prison for a nonviolent offense fueled by addiction and desperation. His incarceration has caused four generations – from his parents who died before seeing their son free to my children growing up without a grandpa – unspeakable pain and trauma. We have lost so much time with him. We just need him safely home.”   <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/decarcerationday">#decarcerationday</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/freethemall">#FreeThemAll</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/covidjustice">#covidjustice</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/carenotcages">#carenotcages</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/endmassincarceration">#endmassincarceration</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/covidcolorado">#COVIDcolorado</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/doyourpart">#doyourpart</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/bringourneighborshome">#bringourneighborshome</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/redemptionisreal">#redemptionisreal</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/clemencyiscompassion">#clemencyiscompassion</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

We continue to in this movement as Black people are both overrepresented in terms of cases of COVID-19 and in correctional settings. This week we are partnering with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/acluofcolorado/">ACLU of Colorado</a> and Colorado Attorneys Against Police Violence (CAAPV) to demand decarceration. </p><p> "A prison sentence should not be a death sentence, but... that is precisely the fate that our panelists fear for their loved ones. Among others, hear from Amber Johnson, the daughter of Ronald Johnson. Mr. Johnson is a 62-year-old grandfather who relies on an inhaler to breathe. He has turned his life around in prison after being convicted of non-violent offenses related to substance abuse, but he is still years away from release.</p><p> Panelists will also include attorneys involved in the lawsuit against the Colorado Department of Corrections and Governor Polis for their failure to protect our vulnerable, incarcerated neighbors from COVID-19. There are hundreds of medically vulnerable, sick or elderly prisoners who pose no threat to public safety, but who face a serious risk of dying of COVID-19 in Colorado’s overcrowded prisons. Join us to decarcerate and save lives."</p><p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/acluofcolorado/posts/3478847435482054">https://www.facebook.com/acluofcolorado/posts/3478847435482054</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackLivesMatter5280/posts/2650006855316531">See More</a><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s526x296/118269723_3475743892459075_3426725831054625827_o.jpg?_nc_cat=100&_nc_sid=b386c4&_nc_ohc=Xu6uLfddzrwAX_vTiPO&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&tp=7&oh=19b468b857c41bc2220a0829127083ea&oe=5F6EEA08" alt="ACLU of Colorado's photo." width="504" height="263" caption="ACLU of Colorado's photo." /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/327107741806314/"></a><p>WED, AUG 26</p><p>Covid-19 Decarceration Panel</p>Online Event<i></i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/discovery/">Causes</a> · 157 people]]></content:encoded>

Many may have their own opinions and perceptions of who he really is. To me this man is a survivor, brother, father, and role model! How could one person endure so many battles and still stand tall ready to fight whatever comes their way? At 12-13 I struggled being home with my mom due to financial disadvantages leaving me and my sister with nowhere to go or no one to turn to. Ishmael stepped in with the little he had to offer us and made the be...st of it. He made sure he picked us up whenever he felt we tried to slack off by uplifting us with his goofy ways, picking us up and dropping us off at school, and even feeding us when he could barely feed himself. Fast forward years later to him becoming a man and having a beautiful daughter named Ishanti. For a couple of years of her life he was away, but the way he stepped up as a father was not shocking to me I knew his capabilities and god knew them as well. Second time around god blesses him again with another beautiful baby girl Isharri and as he tries his hardest to do right the enemy just couldn't help trying to assassinate his character. Ishmael Salaam was then arrested and convicted life without the possibility of parole plus 100 years for a incident he did not oversee nor was he there. Gwinnett county sentenced him without the proper evidence to prosecute him for this incident! How can our black men rise when society continues to paint our men out as monsters ? How can they sentence pedophiles, molesters, rapists, and kidnappers less time with the eligibility of parole? The system is designed to break up our homes leaving single mothers alone to raise kids on their own. It makes it harder for the people who want to do right and have a second chance at life to even find jobs. Months down the line August 20th, 2020 Ishmael lost the mother of his kids to a battle most people fight on the daily known as "Depression". Mashelle committed suicide leaving their kids without the comfort of a Mothers touch or a Father's touch. They need their father more than we can imagine regardless of who is actually there with them right now no one can fill that void or their hurt like he can. SO AGAIN who is Ishmael salaam to me ? ISHMAEL is a King, a survivor, a father, a brother, a grandson, a hero to some, a shadow, a soldier, a giver, a fighter, and a courageous BLACK MAN . PLEASE help me to help him get home to his kids !! If we stand for nothing we are able to fall for anything.” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/blackinmatesmatter">#blackinmatesmatter</a><br /> <a href="https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/bring-ish-home">https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/bring-ish-home</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackLivesMatter5280/posts/2649317215385495">See More</a><a href="https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/bring-ish-home">BRING ISH HOME 1357 people have signed this petition.

These loved ones are too often erased, forgotten and unknown and as a result not uplifted during national actions held here in DC. As part of our Black August events, we are bringing together the families of Black lives taken by the state during this virtual vigil.</p><p> A small group of... family members will come together in person for this very special vigil. We know that the Black community particularly in DC has been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. Therefore we are limiting the in-person attendees and are excited that the vigil will be live streamed. In this way, thousands of people will be able to send their love and support to these families by uplifting the names of their loved ones. We will be live streaming from our Facebook page and we will update people closer to the event on the other ways to watch.</p><p> RSVP to receive updates about how you can volunteer and/or watch. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/DC-ANCESTORS">https://tinyurl.com/DC-ANCESTORS</a></p><p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/nanmow2020">#NANMOW2020</a> #BlackLivesMatter <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/blacklivesmatterdc">#BlackLivesMatterDC</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/blacklivesmatter">#BlackLivesMatter</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/dcprotests">#DCProtests</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/dcprotestors">#DCProtestors</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/ancestorswatching">#AncestorsWatching</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/stopmpd">#StopMPD</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/defundmpd">#DefundMPD</a> #DefundDCPolice <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/defunddcpolice">#DefundDCPolice</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/defunddpd">#DefundDPD</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/defundapd">#DefundAPD</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/defundpolice">#DEFUNDPOLICE</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/defendblacklife">#DEFENDBLACKLIFE</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackLivesMatter5280/posts/2649232365393980">See More</a><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/118081923_4275927402478778_7390114532426895426_o.jpg?_nc_cat=101&_nc_sid=b386c4&_nc_ohc=UbVJNEPQYRsAX-MHnzM&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=2f5eae07c3f3139d6d1bed42aacc9c69&oe=5F6D9261" alt="Black Lives Matter DC's photo." width="500" height="282" caption="Black Lives Matter DC's photo." /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/302353464151932/"></a><p>HAPPENING NOW</p><p>Ancestors Watching Vigil for Black Lives Lost to State Violence</p><i></i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/discovery/">Causes</a> · 1,543 people]]></content:encoded>

Still, we must never normalize watching and reading about any violence enacted on our friends and loved ones, pieces of ourselves, on the internet. We give thanks to the ancestors and higher power that guided #JacobBlake back to share more joyful moments with his children like the one in this picture we are intentionally sharing instead of that horrific video. Today we are reminded that it is an essential component of #Blackliberation to take pause and hold space for our whole selves &mdash;body, mind, and spirit. To choose healing. #Blackhealingisrevolutionary #BlackLivesMatter]]></content:encoded>

Black August, first commemorated by our incarcerated brothers and sisters, is a time to recommit ourselves to the struggle for #BlackLiberation and to honor those who&rsquo;ve contributed to our collective progress and all those who have been lost to unjust violence and systemic racism.<br />
This August 21, join us in a car protest to bring the Black August fight to our local prison walls. We will drive in a mobile protest to the Denver County Jail and the GEO Aurora ICE detention facility to let those who are chained there know that we are with them, we are fighting for them, and we will keep fighting until all chains are broken.<br />
The many injustices faced by those behind bars in the U.S. are today amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Prisons and jails all across the country, where medical neglect is commonplace and quarantining impossible, have become hotspots of infection. Hundreds have died in US prisons from COVID-19, and yet no response has been made to defend against unnecessary death. The mass incarceration of Black, Brown, and Indigenous populations means that they are not only disproportionately affected by the virus outside of jail, but inside as well.<br />
We raise the following demands, recognizing that if they are not met, more unnecessary death is a certainty:<br />
1. Immediate humanitarian release of all ICE detainees and all vulnerable inmates, those convicted for non-violent offenses, and those who have not been convicted at all.<br />
2. Where people remain behind bars, drastically increase medical staffing and supplies to local jails and state prisons, and guarantee sanitary conditions for all inmates.<br />
3. Free all political prisoners!<br />

<br />
Come celebrate with BLM 5280 at our Juneteenth Freedom Day Party! We will celebrate at &ldquo;The Tree&rdquo; (the site of BLM 5280's 2016 135-hour vigil) located across from the City &amp; County Building at 14th Ave &amp; Bannock. Please be advised that parking in that area is limited and/or currently blocked off. <br />
From 10am-12pm, we will have FREE #COVID-19 testing on-site for everyone, regardless of their insurance or immigration status. Results will be available within 3-5 business days. In addition, resources (water, PPE, hand sanitizer, sunscreen) will be available at our new BLM 5280 Action Hub. We will be encouraging social distancing at this event.<br />
<br />
Beginning at 12pm, there will be music (with special guests Brothers of Brass and DJ Big Styles!), food, arts, wellness activities, and celebrations of Black love and liberation throughout the day. <br />
Can't attend, but looking to donate? Venmo @blm5280]]></content:encoded>
