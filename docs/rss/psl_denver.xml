We continue to fight, demanding that:</p>...<p> •APD must immediately fire killer cops Woodyard and Roedema who remain on their force to this day.<br /> •AFD must fire the paramedics who administered no care to dying Elijah, only a massive dose of ketamine.<br /> •Attorney General Phil Weiser must file murder charges against killer cops Woodyard, Roedema, and Rosenblatt.<br /> •The Aurora district attorneys must drop the false charges against the peaceful protest leaders who brought light to Elijah’s case.

Du Bois to be a household name - and it’s not difficult to understand why. One of the founding members of... the NAACP, the first Black man to receive a doctorate from Harvard, and a prolific author, his personal achievements and contributions to Black liberation deserve enduring attention and celebration. </p><p> W.E.B Du Bois was born in 1868 amidst the Reconstruction Era in the United States, the heroic efforts of former enslaved Africans to form their own governments in the South after the Civil War, and remained a constant influence on Du Bois throughout his life. His history of the period ‘Black Reconstruction’ remains a classic to this day.</p><p> DuBois emerged as the main ideological opponent of Booker T. Washington and his Atlanta Compromise, a strategy that encouraged Black people to submit to white supremacist rule, and resign themselves to uplift via trade schools — not to struggle for civil and political rights or equal education. DuBois challenged this arrangement head-on, forming the Niagara Movement, then the NAACP, which fought racist inequality in the full range of U.S. institutions.</p><p> W.E.B. Du Bois’ commitment to Black liberation did not stop at the borders of the US. Du Bois stressed Pan-Africanism as a fundamental tenet in his philosophy of liberation. He attended the first and second Pan-African Conferences, meeting revolutionary leaders from around the world. </p><p> Du Bois’ international solidarity took him on travels throughout the world, studying worldwide fights against oppression. Like many other revolutionaries throughout history, Du Bois came to accept socialism as the only way to end the oppression of all people. His visits to the Soviet Union and revolutionary China resulted in the McCarthy Era US government trying him as an international spy in a theatrical trial. In the last year of his life, Du Bois became an active member of the Communist Party of the USA, stating proudly, “I believe in communism. I mean by communism, a planned way of life in the production of wealth and work designed for building a state whose object is the highest welfare of its people and not merely the profit of a part."</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

In almost a year since the pandemic changed our lives, cities and small towns still do not have rapid testing, PPE or vaccination procedures to meet the needs of workers.</p><p> President Biden said schools should reopen "safely" and yet communities are waiting for the funding and resources necessary to make that happen. From Chicago to San Francisco to Philadelphia, teachers and families are fighting for a safe reopening of in-person teaching and for the resources communities need to survive the economic crisis.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>
