"Homeless Mike" stunt shows unfitness for public service</p><p> Aurora, CO Mayor Mike Coffman disqualified himself as a public servant when he went "undercover" posing as a homeless veteran to launch a demonization campaign against his constituents facing homelessness amidst a deepening housing crisis and deadly pandemic.</p><p> His week-long personal experiment apparently led him to dismiss the entire body of serious research on the issue ...of homelessness. He shared his conclusions with CBS 4 Denver: "These encampments are not a product of the economy or COVID. They’re not a product of rental rates or housing. They are part of a drug culture." When asked if the problem was not about a lack of shelter, Coffman answered, "It really isn’t. It is a lifestyle choice and it is a very dangerous lifestyle choice.”</p><p> It was apparently lost on Coffman that in posing himself as a homeless veteran, he was leaning on the high rates of homelessness among veterans, a disgraceful reality in the United States where men and women are sent to fight and bleed in wars for profit, then return home to find themselves without adequate jobs, healthcare, mental health treatment, and housing. It is these circumstances—not personal choice—which explain why veterans make up 11% of homeless adults in the US.</p><p> Aurora, like every city and town in the country, is on the verge of a major deepening of the current housing crisis. When the federal moratorium on evictions expires, some 520,000 Coloradans—more than 15% of the state population—may face eviction. A great number of Mike Coffman's constituents are hovering on the brink of homelessness, and whether they are able to stay in their homes will largely depend on the actions of our government, not on their "choice" between the "lifestyle" of homelessness or security for themselves and their families.</p><p> In the face of a deepening housing crisis coinciding with a deadly pandemic, now more than ever we need our leadership to understand the hardships facing their constituents and to fight to alleviate them. Mike Coffman has already demonstrated his determination to do the opposite—to demonize those who are struggling in order to justify doing nothing in the face of their suffering.</p><p> As residents of the Aurora area, we call for Mike Coffman's immediate resignation from Aurora mayor.</p><p> <a href="https://www.change.org/p/aurora-mayor-mike-coffman-mayor-mike-coffman-step-down-homeless-mike-stunt-shows-unfitness-for-public-service">https://www.change.org/p/aurora-mayor-mike-coffman-mayor-mi…</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1121834264935729">See More</a><a href="https://www.change.org/p/aurora-mayor-mike-coffman-mayor-mike-coffman-step-down-homeless-mike-stunt-shows-unfitness-for-public-service">Step down, Mayor Mike Coffman.

We strongly encourage every person in the Aurora area to read this and see the sick campaign the city cooked up—we expect to justify future escalated anti-homeless crackdowns.  </p><p> Mike’s week-long experiment apparently allowed him to draw conclusions which fly in the face of all serious research on the issue: “These encampments are not a product of the economy or COVID. They’re not ...a product of rental rates or housing. They are part of a drug culture,” says Mike.</p><p> “This is not about a lack of shelter?”</p><p> “It really isn’t. It is a lifestyle choice and it is a very dangerous lifestyle choice.”</p><p> Homelessness is NOT the product of a moral defect—at least not on the part of the individual. It is the product of a morally deficient SOCIETY that, despite its wealth, allocates the basic necessities of survival based on one’s ability to pay at a profitable rate. We call for Mike Coffman’s immediate resignation, as he has demonstrated a total inability to serve this community by launching this vitriolic campaign against his most vulnerable constituents.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1121795858272903">See More</a><a href="https://denver.cbslocal.com/2021/01/05/homeless-mike-coffman-aurora-mayor-undercover-streets">Mike Coffman's goal was to find out why the problem of homelessness was growing and what he, as a mayor, could do to address it.<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQGL-_chMyhKni9N&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdenver.cbslocal.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F15909806%2F2021%2F01%2FHOMELESS-MAYOR-MIKE-10-PKG.transfer_frame_5218.jpeg%3Fw%3D1500&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQGyz4fWpRfC6JKR" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>denver.cbslocal.com</p><p>‘Homeless Mike’ Aurora Mayor Mike Coffman Goes Undercover To Live On The Streets, Sleep On Sidewalks With The Homeless</p>Mike Coffman's goal was to find out why the problem of homelessness was growing and what he, as a mayor, could do to address it.<a href="https://denver.cbslocal.com/2021/01/05/homeless-mike-coffman-aurora-mayor-undercover-streets">Mike Coffman's goal was to find out why the problem of homelessness was growing and what he, as a mayor, could do to address it.</a>]]></content:encoded>

Those arrested were the leaders to demand justice for Elijah McClain, who was brutally murdered by the Aurora Police Department. They are still in jail, with the exception of ...one person.
