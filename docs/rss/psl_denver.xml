Allende and a core of his staff resisted until the fascist troops stormed the building. Allende was killed.</p><p> By afternoon, all government offices in the country were taken over. Within weeks, thousands of leftists, intellectuals, unionists and supporters of Allende were rounded up and tortured in the National Stadium. Many were executed. Congress was suspended, unions and political parties banned, and habeas corpus eliminated.</p><p> Among these desparecidos was famous Communist poet and singer Victor Jara. Born into poverty to a peasant family, by the age of 6 Jara was already working on a farm. Yet he became a distinguished theater director and played a pivotal role in establishing the Nueva Canción Chilena movement.</p><p> Before Jara was murdered, soldiers smashed his fingers and then mocked him, handed him a guitar and forced him to play a song. In a display of immense revolutionary resilience, with broken hands Jara sang the song that was the anthem of the movement, Venceremos – We Will Triumph. Jara’s life was brutally taken by army lieutenant Pedro Pablo Barrientos. Barrientos who played Russian roulette with Jara until a shot finally rang out. He was then shot another 44 times, and his body  dumped in the street along with the hundreds of others.</p><p> In his final hours, Jara composed one last song on a scrap of paper. The song ends, “How hard it is to sing when I must sing of horror... What I see, I have never seen, what I have felt and what I feel, will give birth to the moment.”</p><p> Victor Jara’s legacy will live on forever in his music and perseverance. No amount of guns, tanks, prisons, or unjust laws can stop the movement towards justice.</p><p> ¡Víctor Jara presente!</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

We are currently only at 1 C warming and already experiencing extreme weather and devastation around the globe. The much-touted Paris Agreement’s voluntary commitments have us on target for 3 C warming, when scientists warn that staying below 1.5 C warming is what is needed to avert catastrophe. </p><p> Despite being in charge of the wealthiest country in the world, the... U.S. government — Democrat and Republican — is doing nothing to mitigate or prepare for the looming catastrophe. Even in the liberal bastion of California, state leadership is not taking the crisis seriously. California is the fifth largest economy in the world, yet there is no money for people’s needs while Big Tech gets tax breaks.</p><p> If humanity is to survive this crisis, we must immediately put all resources into preparing for what’s currently unfolding and what’s to come. We must immediately transition off fossil fuels and restore ecosystems that capture carbon from the atmosphere. We must protect the population from climate disasters and provide real relief for people in the aftermath.</p><p> Capitalism has proven time and again that it is incapable and unwilling to meet the needs of the people. If we don’t uproot the system that has created the climate crisis, that continues to ignore it and go about business as usual, the majority of us face a truly dire not-too-distant future. The people have the power to change the path we are on — to share the challenges together and build a better world for all.”</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1025424461243377">See More</a><a href="https://www.liberationnews.org/govt-silent-as-climate-change-unfolds/#.X1pslpHoqTI.facebook">San Francisco skyline tainted orange from wildfire smoke, Sept. 9 As I write this article from San Francisco, Calif., the sky is dark orange and I need to have my desk lamp on to see, despite that it’s midday.
