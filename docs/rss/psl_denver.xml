Links below. ***</p><p> Statement:</p>...<p> "The Denver Justice & Peace Committee (DJPC) stands in solidarity with the six racial justice organizers who were arrested on September 17. Over the summer, these organizers sought to hold the Aurora police department accountable for the killing of Elijah McClain by holding marches and demonstrations. Some thirty charges have been made against them, ranging from misdemeanors to ‚Äúinciting riots‚Äù and kidnapping, which could mean years in prison.</p><p> It is clear that these arrests, coordinated by the Arapahoe County and Adams County District Attorneys, are aimed at intimidating organizers and silencing the movement for racial justice. In dramatic fashion, one organizer was surrounded by five police cars while driving. In another case, a SWAT team swooped down to arrest the organizer in his home. The arrests appear intended to repress political speech, as four of the people arrested are vocal critics of District Attorney Young, members of the Party for Socialism and Liberation, and advocates for racial justice.</p><p> We understand that this can happen to any protester, who has used their voice to mobilize in the mass movement against racism in every corner of the United States. We stand united against this attack on civil liberties and the ongoing movement for Black Lives.</p><p> At the same time, violations by counter protesters are often ignored. On May 3, Aurora police ignored serious aggressions made against an in-car protest against immigrant detention during a Covid-19 outbreak at the ICE Processing Center. Counter protestors could be seen in videos blocking traffic, attacking activists‚Äô cars, shouting obscenities, and ripping signs from the cars. These acts were witnessed by police in the area who did nothing.</p><p> We feel it is particularly important to stand with the falsely accused protesters, as the attack on their First Amendment rights is the first step in cracking down on everyone‚Äôs rights, especially the rights of Black, indigenous, Latinx, working class, and other traditionally marginalized communities.  </p><p> In light of these events:</p><p> * We demand an end to the targeting of the racial justice movement for intimidation and abuse.<br /> * We demand the arrest of those responsible for the killing of Elijah McClain as he walked home from a convenience store in 2019.<br /> * We call on everyone to join the struggle to end police brutality, build our communities, and achieve racial justice!<br /> * We demand an end to all attempts to silence speech and crush the movement for Black Lives.</p><p> In solidarity,</p><p> The DJPC team<br /> October 1, 2020"</p><p> SIGN ON TO THE SOLIDARITY STATEMENT:<br /> <a href="https://www.pslweb.org/denverorgsolidarity">https://www.pslweb.org/denverorgsolidarity</a></p><p> SIGN THE PETITION:<br /> <a href="https://www.pslweb.org/dropthecharges">https://www.pslweb.org/dropthecharges</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1052406671878489">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/a.393001697818993/1052406461878510/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/121504446_1052406465211843_6916354117416661693_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=IaTSNJey1ScAX9UkB-8&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&oh=72593e13d274a2926a83883511f23ead&oe=5FB2C048" alt="No photo description available." width="500" height="482" caption="No photo description available." /></a>]]></content:encoded>

This recognit...ion results from grassroots struggle to reclaim history for the people.</p><p> European colonizers arrived to the land now known as the Americas more than 500 years ago. This marked the beginning of the brutal pillage and enslavement of entire continents of people. Holidays which commemorate Christopher Columbus whitewash the genocide they spearheaded.</p><p> The passage of time does not guarantee progress. After centuries of exploitation, Indigenous people in the United States face very high rates of poverty, sickness, incarceration, and theft of natural resources.</p><p> Take the example of Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota. Pine Ridge is the site of the Wounded Knee Massacre of 1890, where U.S. soldiers murdered hundreds of Plains Native Americans, including children, women and men.</p><p> Today, the brutality continues but with silent causes. The area has the highest infant mortality rate in the country ‚Äî 300 percent the national average.</p><p> Life expectancy for men on the reservation is just 48 years, and for women, 52 years.</p><p> It was within this context that on Feb. 27, 1973, the American Indian Movement began the 71-day occupation of Wounded Knee to spread awareness of historical and ongoing injustices to Indigenous people.</p><p> The U.S. government waged all-out war against AIM.</p><p> Just as they set out to destroy the Black Panthers and others, the FBI was determined to kill, imprison Native liberation leaders. They falsified evidence to unjustly convict AIM organizer Leonard Peltier, resulting in two life sentences.</p><p> Held at a maximum security prison in Florida, for 44 years Peltier is being deprived of necessary facilities and is seeking compassionate release or commutation of his Free Leonard Peltier! Free all political prisoners!</p><p> Many countries in Latin America had similar colonial-born holidays marking the anniversary of their conquest. On his third voyage in 1498, Columbus planted the flag of Spain in present-day Venezuela.</p><p> The 1999 election of Hugo Chavez to presidency sparked the beginning of the Bolivarian Movement that nationalized the country‚Äôs oil and created major social programs that lifted millions out of poverty.</p><p> In 2002 Ch√°vez declared Oct 12 as D√≠a de la Resistencia Ind√≠gena, the Day of Indigenous Resistance. Columbus‚Äô statue was torn down two years later and the colonizer was tried in a court of public justice. Today not a single statue of Columbus remains.</p><p> Long live Indigenous resistance! Long live the struggle for liberation!</p><p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/indigenouspeoplesday2020">#IndigenousPeoplesDay2020</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

How can we trust the same Chief Wilson who refuses to fire the killer cops who murdered Elijah McClain and 17th District Attorney Dave Young who refuses to press murder charges against them?
