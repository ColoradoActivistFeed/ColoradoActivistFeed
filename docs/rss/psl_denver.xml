Elizabeth McIntire, former hairstylist at Clementine’s, a salon within the Marketplace, voiced concerns to the building owner about the lack of social distancing and number of people allowed to gather inside the Stanley at various events that have occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sh...e was met with immediate hostility, and was banned from the building, and later, fired from her job. </p><p> Today members of the above organizations gathered to spread awareness to community and patrons of the marketplace of this injustice through flyering and with signs. </p><p> We were immediately met with a police force that told us we must stay off Mark Shaker’s private property! But that didn’t stop us from gaining support and attention from the nearby residents and patrons by flyering to the cars and people walking on the nearby sidewalk! </p><p> If one worker is fired for voicing safety concerns any worker could face the same consequences when they voice concerns. Workers should not live in fear of speaking up to protect themselves, especially during a pandemic that has killed hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. </p><p> AN INJURY TO ONE IS AN INJURY TO ALL! </p><p> Stop Mark Shaker's silencing of worker’s safety concerns!</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1106703629782126">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1106703629782126/1106702753115547/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/131338836_1106702756448880_2948121560175980196_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=2&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=_Z1Gsb89D0YAX-6A3yI&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=b8a03d95e65094330b4494b5ed3e4fd8&oe=60006C3C" alt="Image may contain: one or more people, people standing, sky, tree and outdoor, text that says 'DEFEND EVERY WORKER'S RIGHTTOA WORKPLACE DEFEND WORKERS MARKSHAKER CONCERNS'" width="500" height="376" caption="Image may contain: one or more people, people standing, sky, tree and outdoor, text that says 'DEFEND EVERY WORKER'S RIGHTTOA WORKPLACE DEFEND WORKERS MARKSHAKER CONCERNS'" /></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1106703629782126/1106702766448879/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p168x128/131270156_1106702769782212_4969810685490682965_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=2&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=U1nSopWRiygAX9tWX_Y&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=a67b4be5271a4419fdb63679a27a5213&oe=5FFEE45A" alt="Image may contain: one or more people, people standing, sky and outdoor" width="166" height="222" caption="Image may contain: one or more people, people standing, sky and outdoor" /></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1106703629782126/1106702883115534/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p168x128/131372694_1106702886448867_7613958618282150700_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=2&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=sDleQFT0aVkAX-ZYN8X&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=4c1b1644077bbf3454979e783b43a8a4&oe=5FFE7DB7" alt="Image may contain: one or more people, people standing, sky and outdoor" width="165" height="220" caption="Image may contain: one or more people, people standing, sky and outdoor" /></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1106703629782126/1106702833115539/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s173x172/131131386_1106702836448872_6475280063805334784_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=2&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=ZpeUwU0HARcAX8Q5ziU&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=7&oh=c0fe46dc63b1e202e60e417a94146b71&oe=5FFDA136" alt="Image may contain: one or more people, car, tree and outdoor" width="165" height="172" caption="Image may contain: one or more people, car, tree and outdoor" />+4</a>]]></content:encoded>

In many ways, the current “automation revolution” is similar to the introduction of machines in the Industrial Revolution, which radically changed capitalist societies by amplifying inequality, creating a permanent unemployed class that Marxists call the industrial reserve army, and intensified colonialism.</p><p> Today’s automation revolution will similarly transform the landscape of labor, as robotics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning make the automation of vast swaths of complex jobs possible.</p><p> The rise of automation will accelerate the growing inequality that we see today, where the three richest people in the U.S.–Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett–own as much wealth as the bottom half of the country’s population. Capitalism is a hopelessly outdated system, which has only preserved itself through violence.</p><p> We have witnessed the ability of socialism to thrive under far more difficult circumstances. Cuba and the DPRK guarantee housing, healthcare, education for all, despite being small, historically underdeveloped countries saddled with crushing sanctions.</p><p> There is no such thing as a “shortage of jobs.” There is only a shortage of jobs that can be exploited for a profit.

Hampton was just 21 years old, but his life was rich in struggle.</p><p> Hampton was a community-builder. He brokered a nonaggression pact between Chicago’s most powerful street gangs, urging them to turn their anger and guns around on their oppressors, not on one another. He created the Rainbow Coalition, a class-conscious and multi-racial alliance.</p><p> On December 4th 1969, the Chica...go PD drugged Chairman Fred, stormed his apartment and executed him in his sleep, along with Panther leader Mark Clark. Fred’s wife and son somehow survived the volley of 99 bullets. It was a military style invasion and execution.</p><p> This was not an isolated instance. This was US government policy.<br /> Hampton’s murder was part of a pattern of police raids, false imprisonment and executions of Black Panthers. COINTELPRO documents proved that assassination of Black leaders was among its aims. Fred Hampton and the Black Panther Party had to be eliminated simply because they had touched upon capitalism’s greatest weakness—the decisiveness and strength that a multi-national movement has in a battle against this system.</p><p> The Black Panther Party arose from the struggles of the African American people, historically the most oppressed and exploited group in the United States. They symbolized hope and received the greatest affection. They attributed Black oppression to the capitalist system, and dared to pick up arms against the state. The militancy and defiance of these young revolutionaries deeply impacted the Civil Rights and socialist movements.</p><p> Hampton and the Black Panthers believed all would benefit if the banner of the struggle against racism and national oppression was taken up by the white masses as their own. Hampton knew that it was possible to smash the racial barriers created by capitalism to divide and conquer the working class. His confidence was based on the strong belief that this system provides a motive for all to unite and engage in revolutionary struggle.</p><p> Long live the memory of Fred Hampton and the Black Panther Party!</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1098584813927341">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1098584813927341/1098583950594094/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/130157059_1098583953927427_6814982066463741412_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=2KcLTSk3t7gAX9R1f6B&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=5cfafb89d3ccb62debb6170360f19d43&oe=5FFF9204" alt="Image may contain: 1 person, text that says 'FRED HAMPTON 1948-1969 "If you dare to struggle, you dare to win.

People were arrested in a Home Depot parking lot, at their homes, and after they were pulled over while driving. Those arrested were the leaders to demand justice for Elijah McClain, who was brutally murdered by the Aurora Police Department. They are still in jail, with the exception of ...one person. They are facing multiple felony charges and years in prison in an obvious frame-up aimed at stopping the movement for justice for Elijah McClain.</p><p> Add your name to sign the petition and join the campaign to demand that all the charges be dropped! </p><p> Petition text:</p><p> "I demand that all charges be dropped on anti-racist organizers in the Denver area.
