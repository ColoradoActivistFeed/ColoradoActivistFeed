These two comrades showed immense bravery in coming and speaking out against the injustice and cruelty of the criminal justice system, which they’ve now experienced firsthand. Joel would have absolutely been there too if he didn...'t have to be out of town! </p><p> Despite the incredibly difficult experience of going through jail and the facing the upcoming battle to drop the over 30 serious charges that these organizers collectively face, they have not been intimidated by the repressive and violent forces of DPD, APD, and the 18th and 17th district attorneys. Their resolve has only been made stronger against the injustice that they and all prisoners and victims of police violence face. </p><p> Lillian spoke about the meaning of solidarity, telling the crowd how Eliza told her lawyer that if bond was posted for her before Lillian, she would insist on staying in jail despite the horrible torturous conditions she faced until Lillian was released too. </p><p> Eliza spoke of the need to continue the struggle against police terror now more than ever, saying "Let it be known - they wouldn't come after us if this movement didn't SCARE them!" </p><p> The battle to drop the charges is only beginning and everyone in the movement must come together in solidarity at this time to challenge an enemy with more resources but not more numbers, an enemy that uses the power of violence but is no match for the power of the people! </p><p> In the words of Assata Shakur: “We must love and support one another”</p><p> And in the words of Lillian House: “Our determination is so much greater than our fear. Our solidarity is so much greater than the repression. I have never felt more confident that we have what it takes to go the distance. WE WILL WIN"</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1039416439844179">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1039416439844179/1039416243177532/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/120245447_1039416246510865_4987559904828085448_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=xetYm4beNWoAX86D9zT&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=733835632b0a6e105c6be544c8e6881a&oe=5F96A556" alt="Image may contain: 1 person, standing, beard and outdoor" width="500" height="376" caption="Image may contain: 1 person, standing, beard and outdoor" /></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1039416439844179/1039416249844198/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p235x165/120277438_1039416253177531_704037612508986698_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=peERjNJbEA4AX-CAAow&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=064690a58b4eedd0f182308cf9f822fe&oe=5F97FD9C" alt="Image may contain: 1 person, standing and outdoor" width="293" height="165" caption="Image may contain: 1 person, standing and outdoor" /></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1039416439844179/1039416323177524/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p235x165/120301690_1039416326510857_3239961872425579241_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=uqd1ocUMzYYAX-E44Yk&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=ffe6169238f647101fb22daaabae7a1f&oe=5F96E561" alt="Image may contain: 3 people, people standing and outdoor" width="293" height="165" caption="Image may contain: 3 people, people standing and outdoor" /></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1039416439844179/1039416349844188/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p235x165/120314675_1039416353177521_3461196217880440806_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=4g52EOSuGr8AX-0FaKe&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=3990fa0d43e11a62e43dddeee7ac5bb0&oe=5F96AD5A" alt="Image may contain: one or more people and outdoor" width="293" height="165" caption="Image may contain: one or more people and outdoor" />+4</a>]]></content:encoded>

The function of the police in a government that is not meant to serve the working and oppressed people in the country is to control and subjugate the most oppressed sectors of society. The only way we can end this system of death and violence is to organize in our communities and to build solidarity among the most oppressed and exploited to fight in unity against white supremacy and police terror. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/justiceforbreonnataylor">#justiceforbreonnataylor</a></p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/a.393001697818993/1036241360161687/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/120180935_1036241363495020_7887293671970334900_o.png?_nc_cat=110&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=b0HqR9NlJeIAX_lJPsu&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&oh=89b15ca63248775ac57b188351d0201b&oe=5F985051" alt="Image may contain: 1 person, text that says '#JUSTICEFORBREONNATAYLOR SOCIAL &#xc624; NOIS REST IN POWER'" width="500" height="500" caption="Image may contain: 1 person, text that says '#JUSTICEFORBREONNATAYLOR SOCIAL &#xc624; NOIS REST IN POWER'" /></a>]]></content:encoded>

I will fight for my son with everything I have!" - Glynese Northam, Joel's mother</p><p> "Daily, this country is becoming a fascist dictatorship. A group of non-violent protestors (one whose name you’ll recognize) were arrested in Denver today. Not peacefully or quietly arrested, but arrested in a bombastic manner intended to inti...midate, strike fear, shut us up. Don’t you dare shut up. Don’t you dare be intimidated. Speak up louder, take greater action. Don’t worry about Joel, let me do that. After all, he’s proud of himself. His philosophy - “if they’re not trying to arrest you, then you’re not doing it right!” <br /> If anger right now is not your first instinct, you need to ask yourself how much you truly care about your fellow human. After all, Joel has been on the front lines all summer fight for justice. He has not been violent, he has not been looting (I know because I had the opportunity to stand right beside him on various occasions and earlier this year most recently). He has been DISRUPTING THE STATUS QUO AND DEMANDING THINGS CHANGE FOR THE BETTERMENT OF ALL. It doesn’t get more patriotic than that. <br /> I’m realizing more and more that folks simply do not want change for the betterment of all. No form of protest has been deemed acceptable. They either want change for the betterment of themselves or no change at all." - Joel's brother Adam Northam</p><p> "It has been 6 days since my brother in law, Joel’s arrest, and he still sits in prison. He has been denied due process as there has been no Bond hearing, or any court appearance. His phone calls are being cut off, blocked, and disconnected, and he is only allowed to leave his pod for 40 minutes a day.  He has only been given one face mask since arrival, and though there are positive covid cases in the jail, most of the guards aren’t wearing masks and surfaces and pods are never cleaned. Joel Northam, Lillian House, and Eliza Lucero, are sitting in these conditions, after being arrested in their homes, cars, and in parking lots almost a week ago, because of the work they have been doing to hold the DA, Dave Young, and the Aurora police department accountable for their direct hand in the murder of Elijah McClain. These anti-racism organizers are facing multiple felony charges and years in prison in an obvious frame-up, aimed at stopping and silencing the movement for the justice of Elijah. And in the very first stages of this, the state is already functioning as if they are above the law. These leaders are being targeted in an effort to silence their fight for racial justice, and to intimidate others into silence and submission." - Joel's sister-in-law Lisa Northam</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1036100630175760">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1036100630175760/1036100153509141/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/120178706_1036100156842474_5785788203638787316_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=OGT4OD1IYjAAX_PdAuU&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=56b0d0a12ec682490d4dab0045731b40&oe=5F97D148" alt="Image may contain: one or more people, people standing, sky and outdoor, text that says 'CL VANESSA WILSON APO CHIEF TELL HER FIRE ELIJAH'S KILLERS!
