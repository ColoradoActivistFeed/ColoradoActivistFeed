In almost a year since the pandemic changed our lives, cities and small towns still do not have rapid testing, PPE or vaccination procedures to meet the needs of workers.</p><p> President Biden said schools should reopen "safely" and yet communities are waiting for the funding and resources necessary to make that happen. From Chicago to San Francisco to Philadelphia, teachers and families are fighting for a safe reopening of in-person teaching and for the resources communities need to survive the economic crisis.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

It is learning how to take our differences and make them strengths. For the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house.”</p><p> Audre Lorde spent her lifetime confronting issues of oppression under capitalism and inspiring others to do the same. We honor her legacy each time we band together to dismantle all tools of oppression, one at a time.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

Bursting water pipes have caused the evacuation of entire apartment complexes as ice-cold water forces residents to flee into snow-covered streets. Mutual aid groups across the state scrambled to get bus tickets and supplies to homeless camps that were left to die by municipal governments, with hours ...counting down before the streets became undriveable or curfews were enforced. Residents who need shelter are being asked to make reservations over the phone and make the trek themselves, even though local governments have not cleared the streets for driving and public transportation is not running. Cities which lost power at their water treatment facilities are asking residents who also don’t have power to boil their water to make it potable.</p><p> City, state, and private entities alike are deflecting blame, claiming that there was nothing they could have done. ‘You can’t predict the weather’ and ‘We all need to conserve energy’ are common refrains. But the weather was absolutely predictable, and experts and activists alike have been warning that Texas is in danger of exactly this kind of complete infrastructure collapse.“</p><p> Read the full article:</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1147614672357688">See More</a><a href="https://www.liberationnews.org/texas-infrastructure-nears-complete-collapse-as-capitalist-neglect-meets-climate-change-driven-winter-storms/">Four million or more Texans are without power.
