I will fight for my son with everything I have!" - Glynese Northam, Joel's mother</p><p> "Daily, this country is becoming a fascist dictatorship. A group of non-violent protestors (one whose name you‚Äôll recognize) were arrested in Denver today. Not peacefully or quietly arrested, but arrested in a bombastic manner intended to inti...midate, strike fear, shut us up. Don‚Äôt you dare shut up. Don‚Äôt you dare be intimidated. Speak up louder, take greater action. Don‚Äôt worry about Joel, let me do that. After all, he‚Äôs proud of himself. His philosophy - ‚Äúif they‚Äôre not trying to arrest you, then you‚Äôre not doing it right!‚Äù <br /> If anger right now is not your first instinct, you need to ask yourself how much you truly care about your fellow human. After all, Joel has been on the front lines all summer fight for justice. He has not been violent, he has not been looting (I know because I had the opportunity to stand right beside him on various occasions and earlier this year most recently). He has been DISRUPTING THE STATUS QUO AND DEMANDING THINGS CHANGE FOR THE BETTERMENT OF ALL. It doesn‚Äôt get more patriotic than that. <br /> I‚Äôm realizing more and more that folks simply do not want change for the betterment of all. No form of protest has been deemed acceptable. They either want change for the betterment of themselves or no change at all." - Joel's brother Adam Northam</p><p> "It has been 6 days since my brother in law, Joel‚Äôs arrest, and he still sits in prison. He has been denied due process as there has been no Bond hearing, or any court appearance. His phone calls are being cut off, blocked, and disconnected, and he is only allowed to leave his pod for 40 minutes a day.  He has only been given one face mask since arrival, and though there are positive covid cases in the jail, most of the guards aren‚Äôt wearing masks and surfaces and pods are never cleaned. Joel Northam, Lillian House, and Eliza Lucero, are sitting in these conditions, after being arrested in their homes, cars, and in parking lots almost a week ago, because of the work they have been doing to hold the DA, Dave Young, and the Aurora police department accountable for their direct hand in the murder of Elijah McClain. These anti-racism organizers are facing multiple felony charges and years in prison in an obvious frame-up, aimed at stopping and silencing the movement for the justice of Elijah. And in the very first stages of this, the state is already functioning as if they are above the law. These leaders are being targeted in an effort to silence their fight for racial justice, and to intimidate others into silence and submission." - Joel's sister-in-law Lisa Northam</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1036100630175760">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1036100630175760/1036100153509141/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/120178706_1036100156842474_5785788203638787316_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=OGT4OD1IYjAAX_PdAuU&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=56b0d0a12ec682490d4dab0045731b40&oe=5F97D148" alt="Image may contain: one or more people, people standing, sky and outdoor, text that says 'CL VANESSA WILSON APO CHIEF TELL HER FIRE ELIJAH'S KILLERS!

While marching on I-225, hundreds of anti-racist protestors including our own organizers were violently attacked by two white men who attempted to drive a Jeep at top speed through a crowd of innocent people. The two men were not arrested but instead were given assistance by police and let go. This attack was nothing less than white supremacist terrorism intended to halt the advance of th...e anti-racist struggle. </p><p> Today George H. Brauchler, the district attorney for the 18th Judicial District of Colorado, has just announced that he won‚Äôt bring charges against Kyle Scott Faulkison and Greg Goodenough, the two drivers of the Jeep. This is the same DA who brought outrageous, trumped-up felony charges against our organizers in a clearly political attack aimed to scare and paralyze the PSL‚Äôs anti-racist organizing as well as the entire Black Lives Matter movement. </p><p> This is why we chant ‚ÄúCops and the Klan Go Hand in Hand.‚Äù</p><p> The capitalist system in the United States is built on the back of white supremacy. The repressive state apparatus not only exists to maintain working and oppressed people under control through violence and imprisonment but also relies on white supremacist vigilantism to protect the status quo.</p><p> This cooperation between far right fascist elements of the public and the racist criminal justice system couldn‚Äôt be more clear when we look at the way District Attorneys George Brauchler and Dave Young protect the two Jeep drivers as well as Nathan Woodyard, Jason Rosenblatt, and Randy Roedema who murdered Elijah McClain. It should be killer cops and white supremacists sitting in jail cell, not anti-racist organizers like our comrades Lillian House, Eliza Lucero, and Joel Northam. </p><p> Join us Saturday, September 26 at 12PM at the Colorado State Capitol to demand that DAs Dave Young and George Brauchler drop all charges against the arrested anti-racist organizers and prove that their methods of repression won‚Äôt intimidate us!</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1036099923509164">See More</a><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/120121834_1034596600326163_7081875191291772210_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&_nc_sid=b386c4&_nc_ohc=e-9LesaZ5qQAX-CxOPF&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=a62d1bd45536cb0e9a0f7b5f8ae26241&oe=5F950C43" alt="Party for Socialism and Liberation - Denver's photo." width="500" height="282" caption="Party for Socialism and Liberation - Denver's photo." /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/775179416359489/"></a><p>SAT, SEP 26</p><p>#DropTheChargesCO - March and Rally for Arrested Anti-Racist Organizers</p><p>Colorado State Capitol</p> ¬∑ Denver<i></i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/discovery/">Causes</a> ¬∑ 1,034 people]]></content:encoded>
