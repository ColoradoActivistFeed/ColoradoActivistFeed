The function of the police in a government that is not meant to serve the working and oppressed people in the country is to control and subjugate the most oppressed sectors of society.

I will fight for my son with everything I have!" - Glynese Northam, Joel's mother</p><p> "Daily, this country is becoming a fascist dictatorship. A group of non-violent protestors (one whose name you’ll recognize) were arrested in Denver today. Not peacefully or quietly arrested, but arrested in a bombastic manner intended to inti...midate, strike fear, shut us up. Don’t you dare shut up. Don’t you dare be intimidated. Speak up louder, take greater action. Don’t worry about Joel, let me do that. After all, he’s proud of himself. His philosophy - “if they’re not trying to arrest you, then you’re not doing it right!” <br /> If anger right now is not your first instinct, you need to ask yourself how much you truly care about your fellow human. After all, Joel has been on the front lines all summer fight for justice. He has not been violent, he has not been looting (I know because I had the opportunity to stand right beside him on various occasions and earlier this year most recently). He has been DISRUPTING THE STATUS QUO AND DEMANDING THINGS CHANGE FOR THE BETTERMENT OF ALL. It doesn’t get more patriotic than that. <br /> I’m realizing more and more that folks simply do not want change for the betterment of all. No form of protest has been deemed acceptable. They either want change for the betterment of themselves or no change at all." - Joel's brother Adam Northam</p><p> "It has been 6 days since my brother in law, Joel’s arrest, and he still sits in prison. He has been denied due process as there has been no Bond hearing, or any court appearance. His phone calls are being cut off, blocked, and disconnected, and he is only allowed to leave his pod for 40 minutes a day.  He has only been given one face mask since arrival, and though there are positive covid cases in the jail, most of the guards aren’t wearing masks and surfaces and pods are never cleaned. Joel Northam, Lillian House, and Eliza Lucero, are sitting in these conditions, after being arrested in their homes, cars, and in parking lots almost a week ago, because of the work they have been doing to hold the DA, Dave Young, and the Aurora police department accountable for their direct hand in the murder of Elijah McClain. These anti-racism organizers are facing multiple felony charges and years in prison in an obvious frame-up, aimed at stopping and silencing the movement for the justice of Elijah. And in the very first stages of this, the state is already functioning as if they are above the law. These leaders are being targeted in an effort to silence their fight for racial justice, and to intimidate others into silence and submission." - Joel's sister-in-law Lisa Northam</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1036100630175760">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1036100630175760/1036100153509141/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/120178706_1036100156842474_5785788203638787316_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=8SzkPKXYZcMAX9Zn1Ax&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=40d2f8293b790627b384818b05f7977d&oe=5F93DCC8" alt="Image may contain: one or more people, people standing, sky and outdoor, text that says 'CL VANESSA WILSON APO CHIEF TELL HER FIRE ELIJAH'S KILLERS!

While marching on I-225, hundreds of anti-racist protestors including our own organizers were violently attacked by two white men who attempted to drive a Jeep at top speed through a crowd of innocent people. The two men were not arrested but instead were given assistance by police and let go. This attack was nothing less than white supremacist terrorism intended to halt the advance of th...e anti-racist struggle. </p><p> Today George H. Brauchler, the district attorney for the 18th Judicial District of Colorado, has just announced that he won’t bring charges against Kyle Scott Faulkison and Greg Goodenough, the two drivers of the Jeep. This is the same DA who brought outrageous, trumped-up felony charges against our organizers in a clearly political attack aimed to scare and paralyze the PSL’s anti-racist organizing as well as the entire Black Lives Matter movement. </p><p> This is why we chant “Cops and the Klan Go Hand in Hand.”</p><p> The capitalist system in the United States is built on the back of white supremacy. The repressive state apparatus not only exists to maintain working and oppressed people under control through violence and imprisonment but also relies on white supremacist vigilantism to protect the status quo.</p><p> This cooperation between far right fascist elements of the public and the racist criminal justice system couldn’t be more clear when we look at the way District Attorneys George Brauchler and Dave Young protect the two Jeep drivers as well as Nathan Woodyard, Jason Rosenblatt, and Randy Roedema who murdered Elijah McClain. It should be killer cops and white supremacists sitting in jail cell, not anti-racist organizers like our comrades Lillian House, Eliza Lucero, and Joel Northam. </p><p> Join us Saturday, September 26 at 12PM at the Colorado State Capitol to demand that DAs Dave Young and George Brauchler drop all charges against the arrested anti-racist organizers and prove that their methods of repression won’t intimidate us!</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1036099923509164">See More</a><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/120121834_1034596600326163_7081875191291772210_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&_nc_sid=b386c4&_nc_ohc=wODK-flwbqYAX9RxE0p&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=c8d5c9619d4be470a1f97bb8ac154317&oe=5F9117C3" alt="Party for Socialism and Liberation - Denver's photo." width="500" height="282" caption="Party for Socialism and Liberation - Denver's photo." /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/775179416359489/"></a><p>SAT, SEP 26 AT 12:00 PM MDT</p><p>#DropTheChargesCO - March and Rally for Arrested Anti-Racist Organizers</p><p>Colorado State Capitol</p> · Denver<i></i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/discovery/">Causes</a> · 735 people]]></content:encoded>

Just like her daughter, she is a fighter for justice, and is just as concerned with other incarcerated people as she is her own daughter.</p><p> "Seeing my daughter held under these conditions is incredibly difficult.  Knowing that there are countless others being held for days, weeks or months in a system that deprives them of their liberty because they cannot afford their bail or haven't had their bail hearing is devas...tating.  Lillian most likely will be able to post bail but the magistrate levies bail on economically challenged people who, if unable to post bail, are incarcerated until their plea hearings.   This can mean weeks for some.  The conditions they are living in are inhuman with minimal regard to their personal needs.  23+ hours a day locked in a cell with no reading material, television, personal hygiene supplies, or outdoor activity seems unreasonably harsh. No guilt has been determined.  Some do not have family support, some have health problems, some will be unable to post bail, many will lose the jobs they hold.  I don't think most people are aware of the system that operates right under our noses.  Until you or someone you know or love gets ensnared in this atrocious system you will never know the conditions that exist.  When people are talking about their rights being violated because they are asked to wear a mask during a major health epidemic spanning the entire country, hundreds of people are losing their rights in our "justice" system.  How ironic that the people we ask to enforce and uphold our laws are treating so many as less than human, incarcerating them for seemingly arbitrary periods of time with no information being given to them.  I am incredibly proud of my daughter and her comrades and support them 100%.  I believe she is a political prisoner and fervently hope that the issues they are fighting to change will continue to get attention they so deserve."</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1036019293517227">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/a.393001697818993/1036019243517232/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/120074220_1036019246850565_5664272942419493418_n.png?_nc_cat=100&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=8wGhCVi1nrgAX_GhXDP&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&oh=93cda8a74083f9691390a66b70081642&oe=5F93A016" alt="Image may contain: one or more people and outdoor" width="500" height="500" caption="Image may contain: one or more people and outdoor" /></a>]]></content:encoded>

I found out days later his mother had died years ago. The oppression in this country has us calling out for ghosts." </p><p> Today, Glynese Northam is a black mother who is suffering because of the cruelty of this system. As her son Joel is held at the Denver County Jail without bond, we must remember her and support her too. Join us as we support the struggle for ALL black lives on Saturday, September 26 at 10:00 AM at the March 4 Black Women, and then at 12:00 PM stay for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/dropthechargesco">#DropTheChargesCO</a> - March and Rally for Arrested Anti-Racist Organizers and support Joel's mother and the entire movement against racism and police brutality as we demand that District Attorney Dave Young drop all charges for the arrested anti-racist organizers.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1034674056985084">See More</a><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s526x296/119700121_10222945516456150_1923706013482639948_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&_nc_sid=b386c4&_nc_ohc=83MbMBXDVeEAX9CRz_L&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&tp=7&oh=7aa284c1d7a5b70f82d4a1a390418d59&oe=5F915900" alt="Tikneshia Beauford's photo." width="526" height="264" caption="Tikneshia Beauford's photo." /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/712732249278240/"></a><p>SAT, SEP 26 AT 10:00 AM MDT</p><p>March 4 Black Women Denver 4th Annual March For Black Lives</p><p>Denver City and County Building</p> · Denver1,106 people interested]]></content:encoded>

City officials can make this announcement directly delivered to the camp in writing, or send it to info&#064;denverhomelessoutloud.org and we will deliver it to residents for the City. </p><p> If the City needs assistance finding housing or hotels for the roughly 60 residents of this encampment, they need look no farther than the thousands of vacant luxury apartments and hotels. The City can hold master leases on apartments and rent those to people according to their income. They can also set up long term leases at hotels as they move forward in buying vacant hotels. </p><p> Homelessness ends with a home. This is possible. The time is now.
