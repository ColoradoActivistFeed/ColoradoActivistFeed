The camp houses approximately 300 people—most have been funneled there from other sweeps, highlighting the unsustainability of this practice. Once again the city has no answer for where these people are supposed to go.</p><p> We want to once again point out that we have identified ten apartment buildings that together have over 1200 vacant units. These vacancies could h...ouse more people than the entire Denver shelter system and under far safer conditions in this pandemic. (Again, the CDC explicitly advises local governments AGAINST conducting sweeps during the pandemic and advocates for providing individual housing.) We call on the city to open this or similar vacant housing immediately to meet the needs of the people. We demand HOUSING—not sweeps.</p><p> Join us to protest the city’s inhumane and deadly sweeps and stand in solidarity with our unhoused neighbors. We will be heading out to the sweep at 7am Monday morning at 29th & Arkins.<br /> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/">Denver Homeless Out Loud</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1090682524717570">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/a.378847259234437/1090683864717436/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/127660014_1090683871384102_455999161606157622_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=2&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=_w0ODn-F1-oAX_zg5gO&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=87af9e38fccb16c34b3f3876240df113&oe=5FE2D6D6" alt="Image may contain: text that says 'These ten Denver apartment buildings have vacancies totaling 1,217 units: 1.

At the time of this writing, the New York Times is reporting that long-time Biden aide Antony Blinken has secured the position of Secretary of State. Blinken was Deputy Secretary of State during Barack Obama’s presidency, where he was an advocate for some of the most destructive policies undertaken by the administration including the war on Libya and... military strikes against the Syrian government. Earlier in Blinken’s career, when he was a top aide to then-Senator Joe Biden, he advocated the colonial-style partition of Iraq along sectarian lines. Michele Flournoy, the frontrunner to be named Secretary of Defense, recently wrote an article where she emphasized how important it was that the U.S. military be able to credibly threaten to sink all Chinese vessels in the South China Sea in 72 hours.”</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1090181851434304">See More</a><a href="https://www.liberationnews.org/biden-to-unveil-cabinet-picks-hyper-militarist-pro-wall-street-administration-takes-shape/">Desperately-needed reforms under an administration so thoroughly imperialist and reactionary can only be secured through determined, militant struggle. #Biden #wallstreet<img src="https://external.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQD7IvC317HYkSBC&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.liberationnews.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F11%2Frsz_biden_ship-780x470.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQC557FdqVfo2L-j" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>liberationnews.org</p><p>Biden to unveil cabinet picks: Hyper-militarist, pro-Wall Street...</p>Desperately-needed reforms under an administration so thoroughly imperialist and reactionary can only be secured through determined, militant struggle. #Biden #wallstreet<a href="https://www.liberationnews.org/biden-to-unveil-cabinet-picks-hyper-militarist-pro-wall-street-administration-takes-shape/">Desperately-needed reforms under an administration so thoroughly imperialist and reactionary can only be secured through determined, militant struggle. #Biden #wallstreet</a>]]></content:encoded>

We demand nothing less than murder charges against Randy Roedema, Jason Rosenblatt, and Nathan Woodyard. We have seen too many times how these investigations end with the killer cops walking free to sit back and see how this plays out.</p><p> This was our message today to Polis and to Weiser: we are still here, we will not be duped, you do not get the benefit of the doubt, and we will continue to fight until we see Justice for Elijah McClain!</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1088660504919772">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1088660504919772/1088626198256536/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/126949651_1088626201589869_1117900865482364780_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=lhRbAen3pkMAX8ZAxI0&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=a5b6ecd770c5d569eda6745144a4b7c5&oe=5FE5AA66" alt="Image may contain: 2 people, people standing and outdoor" width="500" height="376" caption="Image may contain: 2 people, people standing and outdoor" /></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1088660504919772/1088626251589864/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s235x165/127010937_1088626254923197_7676057059254310139_o.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=bZKxuVMxVSYAX8LQ8vF&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&tp=7&oh=cbc65036a59f437003f9ec5193166fea&oe=5FE557B7" alt="Image may contain: 2 people, crowd and outdoor, text that says 'BLAGK DISABLED IVES STOP THE MATTER FLLD WAR ON MCCLAI BLACK AMERICA!

That surpasses the 74,027 votes she received in 2016. It is a remarkable vote, especially with total censorship of third-party candidates by the media monopolies. Not one third-party candidate received significant national coverage. It is the highest total for any revolutionary soci...alist candidate for president in over 40 years.</p><p> There was a palpable fear of a Trump re-election among many voters who would normally reject both Democratic and Republican candidates and vote for a socialist candidate. This year many opted for Biden.</p><p> Yet despite the obstacles and challenges, our socialist campaign was successful in injecting a revolutionary working-class program into the electoral arena. We reached many hundreds of thousands of people with this truth: Only a socialist, sustainable society can truly resolve the inherent problems that capitalism creates: poverty, racism, war and climate change.”</p><p> Read the full statement!</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1087598125026010">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1087598125026010/1087597885026034/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/126861378_1087597888359367_8947609580901492202_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=2&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=NXGpe1DvxEAAX8ewM8n&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=4ad03d45558b13bac2cada3131ba8698&oe=5FE5A307" alt="Image may contain: 4 people, text that says 'LA RIVA FOR PRESIDENT CAMPAIGN MAKES MAJOR STRIDES FOR SOCIALIST MOVEMENT NITE!'" width="500" height="500" caption="Image may contain: 4 people, text that says 'LA RIVA FOR PRESIDENT CAMPAIGN MAKES MAJOR STRIDES FOR SOCIALIST MOVEMENT NITE!'" /></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1087598125026010/1087598028359353/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p168x128/126517318_1087598031692686_5529086175539398726_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=2&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=NGN96W5zPW0AX-HEQS_&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=58f777ddc34d0ee564ad967129b97109&oe=5FE669F6" alt="Image may contain: 1 person, text" width="166" height="166" caption="Image may contain: 1 person, text" /></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1087598125026010/1087598035026019/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s235x165/126562847_1087598041692685_6358200257435004234_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=2&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=v-9iqRh8lIAAX9puPVo&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=7&oh=34bf8a42e078087dbe86587de7b159c2&oe=5FE3A6A7" alt="Image may contain: text" width="165" height="165" caption="Image may contain: text" /></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1087598125026010/1087597905026032/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s235x165/126500072_1087597908359365_5257329890462633509_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=2&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=h_bHiHHqUYEAX_PliGK&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=7&oh=1695487dd36b661aa92878d1b3f75f99&oe=5FE3CAA9" alt="Image may contain: text" width="165" height="165" caption="Image may contain: text" />+4</a>]]></content:encoded>
