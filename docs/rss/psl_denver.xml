This camp is the last refuge for people who have been swept all summer. Meanwhile there are enough vacant apartments and houses in Denver to house the entire 6,000+  house less population three times over. Instead of providing houses to these people, the only true solution to this crisis, the mayor would rather send police in to forcibly move people who have no where to go.</p><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/p296x100/127006161_2752202561666669_3961392161391160892_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=2&_nc_sid=f2c4d5&_nc_ohc=akRrR4nhTCcAX8ujaDw&_nc_oc=AQk8S3rKIdnhPbAB9y3DU73Iy0VqYH23XX6Y5is19D3MvTQrTQBXAYpPpKQ9C7Fd4SE&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&oh=46577e9aa39ca0efc01c74017b4259a4&oe=5FEE59C0" />948 Views]]></content:encoded>

As a football player he tirelessly fought against corruption in the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA), which he compared to a mafia. He struggled to unionize football players and in the late 90s, Maradona, with other prominent stars, formed the International Association of Professional Football Players to defend players' rights.</p><p> Maradona, also known as "El 10", openly showed his support to left-wing, socialist and progressive movements and governments in the world and specifically in Latin America. He also openly defied imperialism and colonialism and was a firm supporter of the Palestinian cause saying "in my heart I am Palestinian." and "I am a defender of the Palestinian people, I respect them and sympathize with them, I support Palestine without fear".</p><p> He proudly wore a Che Guevara tattoo on his arm and a Fidel Castro one on his leg. He was a close friend and supporter of Hugo Chavez, Evo Morales and Fidel Castro among other socialist leaders. He once said "I believe in Hugo Chávez. I am Chavista. Everything that he and Fidel do, from my point of view, is the best". As a socialist and anti-imperialist Maradona remained a committed supporter of Venezuela's Bolivarian Revolution and progressive social movements across Latin America, never losing hope in the poor and the oppressed to emancipate themselves. </p><p> "I am from the left in the sense that I am (...) for the progress of my country, to improve the life of poor people, so that we all have peace and freedom." [...] "We cannot be bought, we are lefties on the feet, we are lefties on the hands, and we are lefties on the mind. That has to be known by the people, that we say the truth, that we want equality, and that we don't want the Yankee flag planted on us."</p><p> Rest in power, Diego Armando Maradona!</p><p> (Photos via Reuters and Getty)</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

Fidel fought without let-up for his people, for revolution, for socialism.</p><p> Fidel was the ultimat...e revolutionary. He was fully aware of his essential historic leadership in the Revolution, but just as important was his guidance in building the Communist Party of Cuba and continually inspiring a people who would fight no matter the adversities.</p><p> The revolution against the U.S. puppet Batista, which ushered in the Cuban Revolution, was carried out during what would seem an inauspicious time.</p><p> The 1950s were a time of anti-communist hysteria led by the United States which thoroughly dominated Cuba at the time and whose aim was to crush the communist movement and workers’ struggles at home and abroad. Yet, Fidel believed that after Batista’s military coup in 1952, that it was the very time to strike.</p><p> The next year, Fidel led the July 26 assault on the Moncada barracks in eastern Cuba. While the revolutionary combatants were defeated and many killed, the Moncada attack would give birth to the July 26th Movement. In 1956, Fidel and his comrades, including Che Guevara and Raul Castro, launched the guerrilla war that brought down the Batista regime on January 1, 1959.</p><p> The 1950s and 60s was also a time of emerging national liberation struggles in Africa, Latin America and Asia</p><p> Fidel’s steel determination and victory over U.S. imperialism helped revive the ideas of revolutionary socialism in Latin America and across the globe. Many national liberation struggles in Latin America, Africa and Asia gained strength from the assistance of revolutionary Cuba.</p><p> Fidel’s legacy will endure because he leaves a strong country of true revolutionaries, people who have given of themselves countless times as medical workers, as teachers, as construction workers, as military combatants, all for the liberation of humanity.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1092105257908630">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/a.378847259234437/1092104954575327/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/128054634_1092104957908660_1528222301583953425_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=2&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=oYcNtXzllaAAX-NrJpk&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=a71d85ef6df6e082309f59b0c725fa27&oe=5FEC8BF2" alt="Image may contain: 1 person, text that says 'VIVA FIDEL!

At the time of this writing, the New York Times is reporting that long-time Biden aide Antony Blinken has secured the position of Secretary of State. Blinken was Deputy Secretary of State during Barack Obama’s presidency, where he was an advocate for some of the most destructive policies undertaken by the administration including the war on Libya and... military strikes against the Syrian government. Earlier in Blinken’s career, when he was a top aide to then-Senator Joe Biden, he advocated the colonial-style partition of Iraq along sectarian lines. Michele Flournoy, the frontrunner to be named Secretary of Defense, recently wrote an article where she emphasized how important it was that the U.S. military be able to credibly threaten to sink all Chinese vessels in the South China Sea in 72 hours.”</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1090181851434304">See More</a><a href="https://www.liberationnews.org/biden-to-unveil-cabinet-picks-hyper-militarist-pro-wall-street-administration-takes-shape/">Desperately-needed reforms under an administration so thoroughly imperialist and reactionary can only be secured through determined, militant struggle. #Biden #wallstreet<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQD7IvC317HYkSBC&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.liberationnews.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F11%2Frsz_biden_ship-780x470.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQC557FdqVfo2L-j" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>liberationnews.org</p><p>Biden to unveil cabinet picks: Hyper-militarist, pro-Wall Street...</p>Desperately-needed reforms under an administration so thoroughly imperialist and reactionary can only be secured through determined, militant struggle. #Biden #wallstreet<a href="https://www.liberationnews.org/biden-to-unveil-cabinet-picks-hyper-militarist-pro-wall-street-administration-takes-shape/">Desperately-needed reforms under an administration so thoroughly imperialist and reactionary can only be secured through determined, militant struggle. #Biden #wallstreet</a>]]></content:encoded>
