I was the most effective community journalist I had ever been, and I knew I was going to lose my job."</p><p> Lori Lizarraga was one of very few local journalists to give close and careful attention to the political prosecution of lead organizers of the protests for Elijah McClain. When well-known protest leaders, including PSL members, were arrested in September, she was in a small minority of media th...at did not simply regurgitate the police narrative. She took a closer look, interviewed Lillian and Joel directly, and put the real story on TV for Denver-area residents to see — the people most interested in knowing the truth about the police and prosecutors in their area.</p><p> The people of Denver need and deserve honest coverage and journalists who care enough and are brave enough to get it. Unfortunately, in many newsrooms, being the kind of journalist the community deserves is the kind of thing that gets you fired.</p><p> An important note — just as 9News was terminating Lori Lizarraga and other journalists, they brought on George Brauchler as their legal expert, one of the district attorneys who filed this outrageous political case against peaceful protest leaders.</p><p> <a href="https://www.westword.com/news/9news-latina-reporter-kusa-media-discrimination-diversity-11925702">https://www.westword.com/…/9news-latina-reporter-kusa-media…</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1173564083096080">See More</a><a href="https://www.westword.com/news/9news-latina-reporter-kusa-media-discrimination-diversity-11925702">I was one of three Latina reporters let go.<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQHvUor5C7zrUQsP&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages1.westword.com%2Fimager%2Fu%2Foriginal%2F11929754%2Fimage8_opt.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&ccb=3-4&_nc_hash=AQH3gCqqygaPO7xR" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>westword.com</p><p>LatinXed: 9News Got Rid of Three Latina Reporters This Past Year, Including Me</p>I was one of three Latina reporters let go.<a href="https://www.westword.com/news/9news-latina-reporter-kusa-media-discrimination-diversity-11925702">I was one of three Latina reporters let go.</a>]]></content:encoded>

RSVP & share: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/447838909858190/">Live Post-Hearing Update from Targeted Denver Organizers</a></p><p> ••••••••••••</p><p> Six months after the surprise arrests and jailing of peaceful protest leaders Lillian House, Joel Northam, Eliza Lucero, and Terrance Roberts, the activists are in pre-trial hearings. While Elijah McClain’s killers still have faced no consequences, the activists who led the mass peaceful protest movement for justice are being dragged through a grotesque political prosecution that, if successful, could put them behind bars for as many as 48 years.</p><p> Lillian, Joel, and Eliza were in court March 9 and 22 for a preliminary hearing in which the prosecution argued that it has met the minimum legal threshold for the attempted kidnapping charge to go forward to trial. They have been hit with this absurd charge, which alone could carry over a decade in prison, for peacefully protesting outside an Aurora Police station. This Thursday morning, Judge Leroy Kirby will issue his decision, determining whether these activists will have to battle this outrageous charge at trial or whether it will be dismissed now. (The decision relates only to this single charge. They have been charged with dozens of felonies and misdemeanors related to every single peaceful protest for Elijah McClain they held over the summer.)</p><p> Please tune in Thursday evening at 5pm MT when we are grateful to have Joel, Eliza, and Lillian joining us to give a live update on the results of the hearing, how they are doing, and what lies ahead.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

The opportunistic scapegoating of China during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with the intensity by which China is deemed the enemy and adversary of the United States, has driven a widespread Sinophobic sentiment nationally. The Asian American community suffers the brunt of the hatred fomented as a weapon of war. To date, there have been 3,800 self-reported hate crimes against Asian Americans.</p><p> The mainstream media’s failure to label the Atlanta shooting as a hate crime demonstrates the gross disregard and injustice that our communities are facing. Racism is a sick symptom of a system that profits from war and violence. </p><p> Join us in demanding an end to anti-Asian racist violence, an end to violence against women and and end to white supremacy now! Solidarity with Asian Communities, Fight Racism!</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

Four of the victims were of Korean descent, and according to a South Korean news site Chosun, the shooter was heard saying “I’m going to kill all Asians.” </p><p> The alarming rise of white supremacy and fascism cannot be overstated. Nearly three out of every four mass shootings can be linked back to right wing extremism. Contrary to the misleading trope of Asian-Black conflict, community organizers have rejected this attempt to divide Black and Asian communities. We understand that the inextricable link between white supremacy, patriarchy, racism and the war drive is the root cause of this violent atrocity. </p><p> We cannot make sense of this mass shooting without understanding the imperialist, sexist, and racist context in which we currently live. The shooter himself admits his fantasy of “eliminating [sexual] temptation” from places he frequented, which reveals the deeply misogynistic character of this crime. For the sake of argument, even if the shooter does not admit to his racist motives — is the mass killing of women not a hate crime? Nearly half of all female homicides in the United States are committed by an intimate partner. The hyper-militarized patriarchal culture and violence against women is woven into the fabric of this brutal system. This speaks to the century old fetishization and hyper-sexualization of Asian women not only here in the United States, but globally. Women of colonized nations such as Korea, China, Phillipines, Vietnam, etc. have historically been trafficked for sexual slavery during wartime, commonly known as “comfort women.”</p><p> This mass murder takes place during an upsurge in anti-Asian violence. Since COVID-19 was first discovered in December of 2019, hate crimes against Asian Americans rose exponentially due to the racist anti-China blame game which the corporate media and the Trump administration weaponized to deflect the gross mismanagement of the crisis here at home. To date, 3,800 self-reported hate crimes against Asian Americans have been documented. The outrage righteously felt by the Asian American community against this violence has spotlighted the issue nationally. </p><p> Over the last decade, U.S. foreign policy under the Obama Administration has shifted its military resources and focus towards Asia. The increasingly aggressive policy targets China as the ultimate adversary and competitor of the United States. Anti-China propaganda, which fuels intense hatred and racism against Chinese Americans and as a consequence Asian Americans, is designed to justify confrontation and potentially war with China. The propaganda drive was restarted under the Obama Administration and has only intensified with Trump’s racist bigotry. The solution to ending racism against Asian Americans must involve the end of the imperialist war agenda against China. </p><p> With the election of Joe Biden and a new administration many hoped that the country would turn to a new chapter. The Biden administration publicly condemned anti-Asian hate crimes, but these gestures ring hollow so long as members of his administration intensify the war drive and contribute to anti-China fear mongering.</p><p> We send our deepest sympathies to the families of the victims of this crime and to the Asian American community. We will not let the victims of this murderous crime die in vain. We will continue to organize against the dangerous cold-war against China and against racist and sexist bigotry.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

The shooter himself admits his fantasy of “eliminating [sexual] temptation” from places he frequented, which reveals the deeply misogynistic character of this crime. For the sake of argument, even if the shooter does not admit to his racist motives — is the mass killing of women not a hate crime? Nearly half of all female homicides in the United States are committed by an intimate partner. The hyper-militarized patriarchal culture and violence against women is woven into the fabric of this brutal system. This speaks to the century old fetishization and hyper-sexualization of Asian women not only here in the United States, but globally. Women of colonized nations such as Korea, China, Phillipines, Vietnam, etc. have historically been trafficked for sexual slavery during wartime, commonly known as “comfort women.”</p><p> This mass murder takes place during an upsurge in anti-Asian violence. Since COVID-19 was first discovered in December of 2019, hate crimes against Asian Americans rose exponentially due to the racist anti-China blame game which the corporate media and the Trump administration weaponized to deflect the gross mismanagement of the crisis here at home. To date, 3,800 self-reported hate crimes against Asian Americans have been documented. The outrage righteously felt by the Asian American community against this violence has spotlighted the issue nationally. </p><p> Over the last decade, U.S. foreign policy under the Obama Administration has shifted its military resources and focus towards Asia. The increasingly aggressive policy targets China as the ultimate adversary and competitor of the United States. Anti-China propaganda, which fuels intense hatred and racism against Chinese Americans and as a consequence Asian Americans, is designed to justify confrontation and potentially war with China. The propaganda drive was restarted under the Obama Administration and has only intensified with Trump’s racist bigotry. The solution to ending racism against Asian Americans must involve the end of the imperialist war agenda against China. </p><p> With the election of Joe Biden and a new administration many hoped that the country would turn to a new chapter. The Biden administration publicly condemned anti-Asian hate crimes, but these gestures ring hollow so long as members of his administration intensify the war drive and contribute to anti-China fear mongering.</p><p> We send our deepest sympathies to the families of the victims of this crime and to the Asian American community. We will not let the victims of this murderous crime die in vain. We will continue to organize against the dangerous cold-war against China and against racist and sexist bigotry.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>
