As a football player he tirelessly fought against corruption in the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA), which he compared to a mafia. He struggled to unionize football players and in the late 90s, Maradona, with other prominent stars, formed the International Association of Professional Football Players to defend players' rights.</p><p> Maradona, also known as "El 10", openly showed his support to left-wing, socialist and progressive movements and governments in the world and specifically in Latin America. He also openly defied imperialism and colonialism and was a firm supporter of the Palestinian cause saying "in my heart I am Palestinian." and "I am a defender of the Palestinian people, I respect them and sympathize with them, I support Palestine without fear".</p><p> He proudly wore a Che Guevara tattoo on his arm and a Fidel Castro one on his leg. He was a close friend and supporter of Hugo Chavez, Evo Morales and Fidel Castro among other socialist leaders. He once said "I believe in Hugo Chávez. I am Chavista. Everything that he and Fidel do, from my point of view, is the best". As a socialist and anti-imperialist Maradona remained a committed supporter of Venezuela's Bolivarian Revolution and progressive social movements across Latin America, never losing hope in the poor and the oppressed to emancipate themselves. </p><p> "I am from the left in the sense that I am (...) for the progress of my country, to improve the life of poor people, so that we all have peace and freedom." [...] "We cannot be bought, we are lefties on the feet, we are lefties on the hands, and we are lefties on the mind. That has to be known by the people, that we say the truth, that we want equality, and that we don't want the Yankee flag planted on us."</p><p> Rest in power, Diego Armando Maradona!</p><p> (Photos via Reuters and Getty)</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

Fidel fought without let-up for his people, for revolution, for socialism.</p><p> Fidel was the ultimat...e revolutionary. He was fully aware of his essential historic leadership in the Revolution, but just as important was his guidance in building the Communist Party of Cuba and continually inspiring a people who would fight no matter the adversities.</p><p> The revolution against the U.S. puppet Batista, which ushered in the Cuban Revolution, was carried out during what would seem an inauspicious time.</p><p> The 1950s were a time of anti-communist hysteria led by the United States which thoroughly dominated Cuba at the time and whose aim was to crush the communist movement and workers’ struggles at home and abroad. Yet, Fidel believed that after Batista’s military coup in 1952, that it was the very time to strike.</p><p> The next year, Fidel led the July 26 assault on the Moncada barracks in eastern Cuba. While the revolutionary combatants were defeated and many killed, the Moncada attack would give birth to the July 26th Movement. In 1956, Fidel and his comrades, including Che Guevara and Raul Castro, launched the guerrilla war that brought down the Batista regime on January 1, 1959.</p><p> The 1950s and 60s was also a time of emerging national liberation struggles in Africa, Latin America and Asia</p><p> Fidel’s steel determination and victory over U.S. imperialism helped revive the ideas of revolutionary socialism in Latin America and across the globe. Many national liberation struggles in Latin America, Africa and Asia gained strength from the assistance of revolutionary Cuba.</p><p> Fidel’s legacy will endure because he leaves a strong country of true revolutionaries, people who have given of themselves countless times as medical workers, as teachers, as construction workers, as military combatants, all for the liberation of humanity.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1092105257908630">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/a.378847259234437/1092104954575327/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/128054634_1092104957908660_1528222301583953425_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=2&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=A3U0wHs6lLsAX8zAbfp&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=47f97b6214d5a2a200fe5881c8806d61&oe=5FE4A2F2" alt="Image may contain: 1 person, text that says 'VIVA FIDEL!

The camp houses approximately 300 people—most have been funneled there from other sweeps, highlighting the unsustainability of this practice. Once again the city has no answer for where these people are supposed to go.</p><p> We want to once again point out that we have identified ten apartment buildings that together have over 1200 vacant units. These vacancies could h...ouse more people than the entire Denver shelter system and under far safer conditions in this pandemic. (Again, the CDC explicitly advises local governments AGAINST conducting sweeps during the pandemic and advocates for providing individual housing.) We call on the city to open this or similar vacant housing immediately to meet the needs of the people. We demand HOUSING—not sweeps.</p><p> Join us to protest the city’s inhumane and deadly sweeps and stand in solidarity with our unhoused neighbors.

Blinken was Deputy Secretary of State during Barack Obama’s presidency, where he was an advocate for some of the most destructive policies undertaken by the administration including the war on Libya and... military strikes against the Syrian government. Earlier in Blinken’s career, when he was a top aide to then-Senator Joe Biden, he advocated the colonial-style partition of Iraq along sectarian lines.

I am sure you may agree that a call to action must include a call to unite, no matter of the location.”</p><p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/dropthechargesco">#DropTheChargesCO</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1089175068201649">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1089175068201649/1089216501530839/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p403x403/127149277_1089216504864172_7574039030084407330_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=2&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=rXTSObBHnbkAX8BoWz0&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=f11fb73bd41209bc0c6eb8bb30280a75&oe=5FE587DB" alt="No photo description available." width="376" height="500" caption="No photo description available." /></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1089175068201649/1089216518197504/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p403x403/127164878_1089216521530837_2972435282070317438_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=2&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=JIuK6LKEp80AX-En2dU&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=06972a196980447a76fc9babfde7df11&oe=5FE582CD" alt="Image may contain: text" width="376" height="500" caption="Image may contain: text" /></a>]]></content:encoded>

We demand nothing less than murder charges against Randy Roedema, Jason Rosenblatt, and Nathan Woodyard. We have seen too many times how these investigations end with the killer cops walking free to sit back and see how this plays out.</p><p> This was our message today to Polis and to Weiser: we are still here, we will not be duped, you do not get the benefit of the doubt, and we will continue to fight until we see Justice for Elijah McClain!</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1088660504919772">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1088660504919772/1088626198256536/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/126949651_1088626201589869_1117900865482364780_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=xVXhRIVfLGIAX8zURaF&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=695968d26d9e385801be7bc5be6c44b9&oe=5FE5AA66" alt="Image may contain: 2 people, people standing and outdoor" width="500" height="376" caption="Image may contain: 2 people, people standing and outdoor" /></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1088660504919772/1088626251589864/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s235x165/127010937_1088626254923197_7676057059254310139_o.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=bZKxuVMxVSYAX8LQ8vF&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&tp=7&oh=cbc65036a59f437003f9ec5193166fea&oe=5FE557B7" alt="Image may contain: 2 people, crowd and outdoor, text that says 'BLAGK DISABLED IVES STOP THE MATTER FLLD WAR ON MCCLAI BLACK AMERICA!
