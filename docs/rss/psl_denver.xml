"Homeless Mike" stunt shows unfitness for public service</p><p> Aurora, CO Mayor Mike Coffman disqualified himself as a public servant when he went "undercover" posing as a homeless veteran to launch a demonization campaign against his constituents facing homelessness amidst a deepening housing crisis and deadly pandemic.</p><p> His week-long personal experiment apparently led him to dismiss the entire body of serious research on the issue ...of homelessness. He shared his conclusions with CBS 4 Denver: "These encampments are not a product of the economy or COVID. They‚Äôre not a product of rental rates or housing. They are part of a drug culture." When asked if the problem was not about a lack of shelter, Coffman answered, "It really isn‚Äôt. It is a lifestyle choice and it is a very dangerous lifestyle choice.‚Äù</p><p> It was apparently lost on Coffman that in posing himself as a homeless veteran, he was leaning on the high rates of homelessness among veterans, a disgraceful reality in the United States where men and women are sent to fight and bleed in wars for profit, then return home to find themselves without adequate jobs, healthcare, mental health treatment, and housing. It is these circumstances‚Äînot personal choice‚Äîwhich explain why veterans make up 11% of homeless adults in the US.</p><p> Aurora, like every city and town in the country, is on the verge of a major deepening of the current housing crisis. When the federal moratorium on evictions expires, some 520,000 Coloradans‚Äîmore than 15% of the state population‚Äîmay face eviction. A great number of Mike Coffman's constituents are hovering on the brink of homelessness, and whether they are able to stay in their homes will largely depend on the actions of our government, not on their "choice" between the "lifestyle" of homelessness or security for themselves and their families.</p><p> In the face of a deepening housing crisis coinciding with a deadly pandemic, now more than ever we need our leadership to understand the hardships facing their constituents and to fight to alleviate them. Mike Coffman has already demonstrated his determination to do the opposite‚Äîto demonize those who are struggling in order to justify doing nothing in the face of their suffering.</p><p> As residents of the Aurora area, we call for Mike Coffman's immediate resignation from Aurora mayor.</p><p> <a href="https://www.change.org/p/aurora-mayor-mike-coffman-mayor-mike-coffman-step-down-homeless-mike-stunt-shows-unfitness-for-public-service">https://www.change.org/p/aurora-mayor-mike-coffman-mayor-mi‚Ä¶</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1121834264935729">See More</a><a href="https://www.change.org/p/aurora-mayor-mike-coffman-mayor-mike-coffman-step-down-homeless-mike-stunt-shows-unfitness-for-public-service">Step down, Mayor Mike Coffman.

Right now 15% of children in the state are not eating enough because their family can‚Äôt afford it! Families are having to decide between feeding their children and paying their rent. This is unacceptable!</p><p> Yesterday we led a car protest through working class neighborhoods in the city, where so many families are in deep crisis or on the verge of it. Our message ...is that we can and we must demand more from our government!</p><p> We call on Governor Polis to immediately institute real housing relief policies to address the severe crisis the people of this state are facing. We demand:</p><p> 1. Cancel the rents and mortgages.<br /> 2. No evictions.<br /> 3. No foreclosures.<br /> 4. Full housing rights for all undocumented people.<br /> 5. Housing for the homeless.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1115657265553429">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1115657265553429/1115650465554109/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/133953701_1115650468887442_5216364771215124078_o.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=dch2cVtsMm0AX8M2fx_&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=b33a96dbfdfba59be016e56ad2418f09&oe=601D6114" alt="Image may contain: 1 person, standing, tree, sky and outdoor" width="500" height="375" caption="Image may contain: 1 person, standing, tree, sky and outdoor" /></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1115657265553429/1115648715554284/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s235x165/133828940_1115648718887617_6330097266454452903_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=OdXCLAnkXP4AX8Btezc&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=7&oh=4a6bbf9f7a2f20bb9e265f11f5eacb47&oe=60204FD1" alt="Image may contain: 1 person, tree, plant, house and outdoor" width="186" height="165" caption="Image may contain: 1 person, tree, plant, house and outdoor" /></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1115657265553429/1115648768887612/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s235x165/134115166_1115648772220945_5628222712000524515_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=UZ4cX8KorJEAX-53fxO&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=7&oh=8e257b7943f7b6dbf613d032da5bc613&oe=60201D3E" alt="Image may contain: one or more people, people standing, house and outdoor" width="199" height="165" caption="Image may contain: one or more people, people standing, house and outdoor" /></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1115657265553429/1115648668887622/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p168x128/133790491_1115648675554288_36844787941198710_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=H0IClA3kClAAX8Ad_7F&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=7b0f97a9c34b48ec02e086a6e0b78d9d&oe=601E2FEC" alt="Image may contain: 1 person, standing, tree, plant, house and outdoor, text that says 'PROUD TOBEA PATRIO'" width="165" height="200" caption="Image may contain: 1 person, standing, tree, plant, house and outdoor, text that says 'PROUD TOBEA PATRIO'" />+33</a>]]></content:encoded>
