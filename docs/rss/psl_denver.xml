Three of the organizers are facing multiple felony charges and years of prison for organizing protests for justice for Elijah McClain. We demand that the ludicrous felony charges and misdemeanors such as “kidnapping” be dropped and free them now!</p><p> We were accompanied by Joel Northam’s brother, Adam, and his family who spoke passionately about Joel’s inspiring character and work as an organizer. While the media prepares to portray Joel and the other imprisoned members as “bad people”, Adam countered the narrative with personal anecdotes of Joel’s deep love for the people. As PSL Philly member Kayla said, “these organizers do WAY more for their communities than any police department does. All four of them are committed to the work of building people power in their neighborhoods, serving the people, and educating others.”</p><p> Philadelphia stands in fierce solidarity with our members in Denver who are held as political prisoners and ALL victims of police terror. We will not back down from their scare tactics. We will do what we always do - stand up, fight back!</p><p> Sign the petition at <a href="http://pslweb.org/dropthecharges">pslweb.org/dropthecharges</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

Yesterday, on one day's notice, over 1,000 people gathered for an emergency protest demanding that charges be dropped against anti-racist organizers. </p><p> Community members met in front of the State Capitol Building to hear speak-outs from the arrestees' family and fellow community leaders, then marched through the streets downtown to the Downtown Detention Center, where the speakers and crowd made so much noise that it was heard by the organizers jailed inside!...</p><p> On Thursday, September 17, police agencies in the Denver area arrested multiple anti-racist organizers in a coordinated assault. Those arrested included leaders of the large-scale peaceful protests over the past few months that demanded justice for Elijah McClain, who was brutally murdered by the Aurora Police Department. Three are still in jail. They are facing multiple felony charges and years in prison in an obvious frame-up aimed at stopping the movement against police brutality.</p><p> Russell Ruch was arrested while in a parking lot at a Home Depot. An hour later, five police cars surrounded and arrested Lillian House while she was driving. In the afternoon, S.W.A.T. teams arrived at Joel Northam’s home and arrested him. Eliza Lucero was also arrested at her home. All four are members of the Party for Socialism and Liberation. Also arrested was Terrance Roberts, co-founder of the Frontline Party for Revolutionary Action.</p><p> They are facing multiple serious felony charges and many misdemeanors including the bizarre and ludicrous charge of “kidnapping,” all because they have organized large Black Lives Matter protests. This is a major political attack on the whole movement and the PSL. </p><p> We are mounting a mass campaign to defeat these phony charges and win their freedom! This attack is part of a concerted national assault against the Black Lives Matter movement, an attack driven directly from the White House, from Governor’s mansions, and from local police chiefs and police departments around the country. </p><p> We are not afraid! We have the power of the people on our side! Stand up, fight back! </p><p> To show your support for these organizers, demand that the charges be dropped and support our campaign!</p><p> SIGN THE PETITION:<br /> <a href="https://www.pslweb.org/dropthecharges">https://www.pslweb.org/dropthecharges</a></p><p> DONATE TO THE CAMPAIGN:<br /> <a href="https://www.pslweb.org/donate4denver">https://www.pslweb.org/donate4denver</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/a.1033489393770217/1033490133770143/">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/">Drop the Charges!

People were arrested in a Home Depot parking lot, at their homes..., and after they were pulled over while driving. Those arrested were the leaders to demand justice for Elijah McClain, who was brutally murdered by the Aurora Police Department. They are still in jail, with the exception of one person. They are facing multiple felony charges and years in prison in an obvious frame-up aimed at stopping the movement for justice for Elijah McClain. Drop the charges!</p><p> Please join an Emergency Livestream tonight, Sept. 17th for updates on this developing situation, and the PSL’s plans to mobilize against this government attack.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

Allende and a core of his staff resisted until the fascist troops stormed the building. Allende was killed.</p><p> By afternoon, all government offices in the country were taken over. Within weeks, thousands of leftists, intellectuals, unionists and supporters of Allende were rounded up and tortured in the National Stadium. Many were executed. Congress was suspended, unions and political parties banned, and habeas corpus eliminated.</p><p> Among these desparecidos was famous Communist poet and singer Victor Jara. Born into poverty to a peasant family, by the age of 6 Jara was already working on a farm. Yet he became a distinguished theater director and played a pivotal role in establishing the Nueva Canción Chilena movement.</p><p> Before Jara was murdered, soldiers smashed his fingers and then mocked him, handed him a guitar and forced him to play a song. In a display of immense revolutionary resilience, with broken hands Jara sang the song that was the anthem of the movement, Venceremos – We Will Triumph. Jara’s life was brutally taken by army lieutenant Pedro Pablo Barrientos. Barrientos who played Russian roulette with Jara until a shot finally rang out. He was then shot another 44 times, and his body  dumped in the street along with the hundreds of others.</p><p> In his final hours, Jara composed one last song on a scrap of paper. The song ends, “How hard it is to sing when I must sing of horror... What I see, I have never seen, what I have felt and what I feel, will give birth to the moment.”</p><p> Victor Jara’s legacy will live on forever in his music and perseverance. No amount of guns, tanks, prisons, or unjust laws can stop the movement towards justice.</p><p> ¡Víctor Jara presente!</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

We are currently only at 1 C warming and already experiencing extreme weather and devastation around the globe. The much-touted Paris Agreement’s voluntary commitments have us on target for 3 C warming, when scientists warn that staying below 1.5 C warming is what is needed to avert catastrophe. </p><p> Despite being in charge of the wealthiest country in the world, the... U.S. government — Democrat and Republican — is doing nothing to mitigate or prepare for the looming catastrophe. Even in the liberal bastion of California, state leadership is not taking the crisis seriously. California is the fifth largest economy in the world, yet there is no money for people’s needs while Big Tech gets tax breaks.</p><p> If humanity is to survive this crisis, we must immediately put all resources into preparing for what’s currently unfolding and what’s to come. We must immediately transition off fossil fuels and restore ecosystems that capture carbon from the atmosphere. We must protect the population from climate disasters and provide real relief for people in the aftermath.</p><p> Capitalism has proven time and again that it is incapable and unwilling to meet the needs of the people. If we don’t uproot the system that has created the climate crisis, that continues to ignore it and go about business as usual, the majority of us face a truly dire not-too-distant future. The people have the power to change the path we are on — to share the challenges together and build a better world for all.”</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1025424461243377">See More</a><a href="https://www.liberationnews.org/govt-silent-as-climate-change-unfolds/#.X1pslpHoqTI.facebook">San Francisco skyline tainted orange from wildfire smoke, Sept. 9 As I write this article from San Francisco, Calif., the sky is dark orange and I need to have my desk lamp on to see, despite that it’s midday.
