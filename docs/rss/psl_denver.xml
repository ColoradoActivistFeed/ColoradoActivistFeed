We strongly encourage every person in the Aurora area to read this and see the sick campaign the city cooked up—we expect to justify future escalated anti-homeless crackdowns.  </p><p> Mike’s week-long experiment apparently allowed him to draw conclusions which fly in the face of all serious research on the issue: “These encampments are not a product of the economy or COVID. They’re not ...a product of rental rates or housing. They are part of a drug culture,” says Mike.</p><p> “This is not about a lack of shelter?”</p><p> “It really isn’t. It is a lifestyle choice and it is a very dangerous lifestyle choice.”</p><p> Homelessness is NOT the product of a moral defect—at least not on the part of the individual. It is the product of a morally deficient SOCIETY that, despite its wealth, allocates the basic necessities of survival based on one’s ability to pay at a profitable rate. We call for Mike Coffman’s immediate resignation, as he has demonstrated a total inability to serve this community by launching this vitriolic campaign against his most vulnerable constituents.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1121795858272903">See More</a><a href="https://denver.cbslocal.com/2021/01/05/homeless-mike-coffman-aurora-mayor-undercover-streets">Mike Coffman's goal was to find out why the problem of homelessness was growing and what he, as a mayor, could do to address it.<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQGL-_chMyhKni9N&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdenver.cbslocal.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F15909806%2F2021%2F01%2FHOMELESS-MAYOR-MIKE-10-PKG.transfer_frame_5218.jpeg%3Fw%3D1500&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQGyz4fWpRfC6JKR" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>denver.cbslocal.com</p><p>‘Homeless Mike’ Aurora Mayor Mike Coffman Goes Undercover To Live On The Streets, Sleep On Sidewalks With The Homeless</p>Mike Coffman's goal was to find out why the problem of homelessness was growing and what he, as a mayor, could do to address it.<a href="https://denver.cbslocal.com/2021/01/05/homeless-mike-coffman-aurora-mayor-undercover-streets">Mike Coffman's goal was to find out why the problem of homelessness was growing and what he, as a mayor, could do to address it.</a>]]></content:encoded>
