In a press conference, Gov. Jared Polis, one of the richest men in America, laughed at the idea of prioritizing prisoners.</p><p> Prisoners are at a higher risk of catching COVID-19 and dying or suffering serious symptoms. They cannot socially distance ...and they must share bathrooms and sleeping spaces. Systemic poverty and racism mean they have often had poor or nonexistent health care their entire lives and several underlying conditions.</p><p> The U.S. has by far the largest incarcerated population in the world, 2.3 million people. Massive overcrowding, squalid conditions, and rampant abuse have long been the norm in prisons and jails across the country. Instead of seriously pursuing early release, reduced admissions, and other obviously necessary reforms during the pandemic, politicians and prison officials have deliberately allowed conditions to become even worse.</p><p> It is clear the prison system under U.S. capitalism is not a tool for "rehabilitation", but for social control of poor and oppressed people, especially communities suffering under the boot of white supremacy. </p><p> From the article:</p><p> "A combination of extended lockdowns, short staffing and rising anxiety about COVID-19 has created a situation in Colorado’s prisons that the director of the state’s prisons called “tenuous” and that has outraged inmates’ families.</p><p> Prisoners are fed substandard meals — sometimes as little as two slices of bread, a piece of bologna, and an apple — and sometimes are not able to access showers for days at a time, eight families and a former guard said. Staffing is stretched thin as guards fall ill and hundreds are placed on leave on a given day. Some inmates go weeks without stepping outside.</p><p> “He just feels so less than human,” said Krystal Griffiths, whose fiancé is incarcerated at the Buena Vista prison." </p><p> Read more: <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/12/19/colorado-prisons-coronavirus-staffing-conditions/">https://www.denverpost.com/…/colorado-prisons-coronavirus-…/</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1109160882869734">See More</a><a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/12/19/colorado-prisons-coronavirus-staffing-conditions/">Prisoners are being fed substandard meals — sometimes as little as two slices of bread, a piece of bologna, and an apple — and sometimes are not able to access showers for days at a tim…<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQEucc-dpRZOwCce&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.denverpost.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F12%2FTDP-L-PORTRAITS-RE-_FJA8519.jpg%3Fw%3D1024%26h%3D725&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQFYsKJwznvJJlwZ" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>denverpost.com</p><p>Staff shortages, extended lockdowns in coronavirus-ridden Colorado prisons create “tenuous” situations</p>Prisoners are being fed substandard meals — sometimes as little as two slices of bread, a piece of bologna, and an apple — and sometimes are not able to access showers for days at a tim…<a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/12/19/colorado-prisons-coronavirus-staffing-conditions/">Prisoners are being fed substandard meals — sometimes as little as two slices of bread, a piece of bologna, and an apple — and sometimes are not able to access showers for days at a tim…</a>]]></content:encoded>

This interview is essential reading, as it discusses our response to the recent election, the growing interest in socialism in the US, our approach to the trade union movement, and more. Part one focuses on the political prosecution and charges that Lillian and others are facing, read it here: <a href="https://www.lookleft.ie/2020/12/the-price-of-protesting-the-police/">https://www.lookleft.ie/…/the-price-of-prote...sting-the-poli…/</a></p><p> "There is a tendency in US politics for the progressive sectors to diminish their militancy and focussed organising when Democrats take control of the white house. Some fear that organising against a Democratic administration strengthens the Right and the Republicans, and these parts of the US Left begin to either self-censor or to act as if they are simply a friendly lobby that acts for the Democratic Party to make this or that concession.</p><p> This is a fundamental weakness in US left politics. Right now there needs to be an intensifying political class struggle to fight back against the capitalist government which continues to function as a servant for Wall Street and the military industrial complex. There should be no “honeymoon period” for the Biden administration. It is an aggressive, imperialist, and anti-worker government, and even if Biden were to nominate a few liberals to sprinkle around in his cabinets, we would not change our characterisation of his administration one iota.</p><p> The biggest, looming issues in America are the crisis in housing, massive unemployment, and growing hunger. The stock exchange is breaking records because both ruling class parties are rewarding the capitalists with huge cash infusions and loan guarantees, but tens of millions of workers are facing absolute and utter ruin. Millions are literally in line waiting for food handouts, and we believe this crisis is going to grow.</p><p> The PSL intends to focus on the section of the population, again numbering in the tens of millions, who are in absolute existential crisis and for whom the capitalist system has turned into nothing more than a nightmare."</p><p> <a href="https://www.lookleft.ie/2020/12/the-struggle-doesnt-end-when-trump-leaves-office/">https://www.lookleft.ie/…/the-struggle-doesnt-end-when-tru…/</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1108699839582505">See More</a><a href="https://www.lookleft.ie/2020/12/the-struggle-doesnt-end-when-trump-leaves-office/">"The PSL understands that the state apparatus is a permanent state, not something that changes every four years. In the past few years, people have mistakenly used the labelling of this permanent state as 'the deep state.' We prefer to just call it the capitalist state."<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQHue7sEA6NowHfu&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lookleft.ie%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F12%2FEmPcHwsVoAwdNwz-1.png&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQGl8OMlCQzIPls7" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>lookleft.ie</p><p>The struggle doesn't end when Trump leaves office</p>"The PSL understands that the state apparatus is a permanent state, not something that changes every four years.

Elizabeth McIntire, former hairstylist at Clementine’s, a salon within the Marketplace, voiced concerns to the building owner about the lack of social distancing and number of people allowed to gather inside the Stanley at various events that have occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sh...e was met with immediate hostility, and was banned from the building, and later, fired from her job. </p><p> Today members of the above organizations gathered to spread awareness to community and patrons of the marketplace of this injustice through flyering and with signs. </p><p> We were immediately met with a police force that told us we must stay off Mark Shaker’s private property! But that didn’t stop us from gaining support and attention from the nearby residents and patrons by flyering to the cars and people walking on the nearby sidewalk! </p><p> If one worker is fired for voicing safety concerns any worker could face the same consequences when they voice concerns.

People were arrested in a Home Depot parking lot, at their homes, and after they were pulled over while driving. Those arrested were the leaders to demand justice for Elijah McClain, who was brutally murdered by the Aurora Police Department. They are still in jail, with the exception of ...one person. They are facing multiple felony charges and years in prison in an obvious frame-up aimed at stopping the movement for justice for Elijah McClain.</p><p> Add your name to sign the petition and join the campaign to demand that all the charges be dropped! </p><p> Petition text:</p><p> "I demand that all charges be dropped on anti-racist organizers in the Denver area.
