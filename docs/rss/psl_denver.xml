In many ways, the current “automation revolution” is similar to the introduction of machines in the Industrial Revolution, which radically changed capitalist societies by amplifying inequality, creating a permanent unemployed class that Marxists call the industrial reserve army, and intensified colonialism.</p><p> Today’s automation revolution will similarly transform the landscape of labor, as robotics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning make the automation of vast swaths of complex jobs possible.</p><p> The rise of automation will accelerate the growing inequality that we see today, where the three richest people in the U.S.–Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett–own as much wealth as the bottom half of the country’s population. Capitalism is a hopelessly outdated system, which has only preserved itself through violence.</p><p> We have witnessed the ability of socialism to thrive under far more difficult circumstances. Cuba and the DPRK guarantee housing, healthcare, education for all, despite being small, historically underdeveloped countries saddled with crushing sanctions.</p><p> There is no such thing as a “shortage of jobs.” There is only a shortage of jobs that can be exploited for a profit. There is plenty of work to be done, and with socialism we could fully utilize the vast potential of the working class.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

Hampton was just 21 years old, but his life was rich in struggle.</p><p> Hampton was a community-builder. He brokered a nonaggression pact between Chicago’s most powerful street gangs, urging them to turn their anger and guns around on their oppressors, not on one another. He created the Rainbow Coalition, a class-conscious and multi-racial alliance.</p><p> On December 4th 1969, the Chica...go PD drugged Chairman Fred, stormed his apartment and executed him in his sleep, along with Panther leader Mark Clark. Fred’s wife and son somehow survived the volley of 99 bullets. It was a military style invasion and execution.</p><p> This was not an isolated instance. This was US government policy.<br /> Hampton’s murder was part of a pattern of police raids, false imprisonment and executions of Black Panthers. COINTELPRO documents proved that assassination of Black leaders was among its aims. Fred Hampton and the Black Panther Party had to be eliminated simply because they had touched upon capitalism’s greatest weakness—the decisiveness and strength that a multi-national movement has in a battle against this system.</p><p> The Black Panther Party arose from the struggles of the African American people, historically the most oppressed and exploited group in the United States. They symbolized hope and received the greatest affection. They attributed Black oppression to the capitalist system, and dared to pick up arms against the state. The militancy and defiance of these young revolutionaries deeply impacted the Civil Rights and socialist movements.</p><p> Hampton and the Black Panthers believed all would benefit if the banner of the struggle against racism and national oppression was taken up by the white masses as their own. Hampton knew that it was possible to smash the racial barriers created by capitalism to divide and conquer the working class. His confidence was based on the strong belief that this system provides a motive for all to unite and engage in revolutionary struggle.</p><p> Long live the memory of Fred Hampton and the Black Panther Party!</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1098584813927341">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1098584813927341/1098583950594094/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/130157059_1098583953927427_6814982066463741412_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=X634TiZ_tCMAX_EgLql&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=5ff790c99bbc1adcdfccb6f9b923d343&oe=5FF3B484" alt="Image may contain: 1 person, text that says 'FRED HAMPTON 1948-1969 "If you dare to struggle, you dare to win.

This camp is the last refuge for people who have been swept all summer. Meanwhile there are enough vacant apartments and houses in Denver to house the entire 6,000+  house less population three times over. Instead of providing houses to these people, the only true solution to this crisis, the mayor would rather send police in to forcibly move people who have no where to go.</p><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/p296x100/127006161_2752202561666669_3961392161391160892_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=2&_nc_sid=f2c4d5&_nc_ohc=r5Xi_arKbaMAX-FuOZe&_nc_oc=AQmMADu0SlHDO0IKIma_hNGotV_W7A4jn6isHG1lA7o_lgbasVTA4TgE00vubXeKsBM&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&oh=3ada06d16f1486756e53132009951004&oe=5FF24E40" />1.2K Views]]></content:encoded>

As a football player he tirelessly fought against corruption in the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA), which he compared to a mafia. He struggled to unionize football players and in the late 90s, Maradona, with other prominent stars, formed the International Association of Professional Football Players to defend players' rights.</p><p> Maradona, also known as "El 10", openly showed his support to left-wing, socialist and progressive movements and governments in the world and specifically in Latin America. He also openly defied imperialism and colonialism and was a firm supporter of the Palestinian cause saying "in my heart I am Palestinian." and "I am a defender of the Palestinian people, I respect them and sympathize with them, I support Palestine without fear".</p><p> He proudly wore a Che Guevara tattoo on his arm and a Fidel Castro one on his leg. He was a close friend and supporter of Hugo Chavez, Evo Morales and Fidel Castro among other socialist leaders. He once said "I believe in Hugo Chávez. I am Chavista. Everything that he and Fidel do, from my point of view, is the best". As a socialist and anti-imperialist Maradona remained a committed supporter of Venezuela's Bolivarian Revolution and progressive social movements across Latin America, never losing hope in the poor and the oppressed to emancipate themselves. </p><p> "I am from the left in the sense that I am (...) for the progress of my country, to improve the life of poor people, so that we all have peace and freedom." [...] "We cannot be bought, we are lefties on the feet, we are lefties on the hands, and we are lefties on the mind. That has to be known by the people, that we say the truth, that we want equality, and that we don't want the Yankee flag planted on us."</p><p> Rest in power, Diego Armando Maradona!</p><p> (Photos via Reuters and Getty)</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>
