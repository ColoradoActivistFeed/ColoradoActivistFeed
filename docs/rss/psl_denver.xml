She is heard saying she can’t breathe, just like Elijah McClain, George Floyd, Eric Garner and so many others. APD Chief Vanessa Wilson has claimed that had Shataean died in the patrol car Officer Huffine would be in jail. So there's only a crime if someone dies? How can we trust the same Chief Wilson who refuses to fire the killer cops who murdered Elijah McClain and 17th District Attorney Dave Young who refuses to press murder charges against them? Dave Young would rather press kidnapping charges against activists for organizing protests demanding Justice for Elijah McClain, which gained international attention, than press charges against violent cops.</p><a href="https://denver.cbslocal.com/2020/09/29/shataean-kelly-levi-huffine-aurora-police-video-released-woman-struggling-back-patrol-car/">Aurora's chief said bodycam video appears to show one of her former officers, Levi Huffine, "punishing" a female prisoner.<img src="https://external.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQCFhLQBHJzZwbih&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdenver.cbslocal.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F15909806%2F2020%2F09%2Fvideo-aurora-police.jpg%3Fw%3D1500&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQDM_MSXWOqk1PAB" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>denver.cbslocal.com</p><p>Aurora Police Video Released Of Woman Cuffed, Hogtied In Back Of Patrol Car: 'Please Don't Let Me Die Back Here'</p>Aurora's chief said bodycam video appears to show one of her former officers, Levi Huffine, "punishing" a female prisoner.<a href="https://denver.cbslocal.com/2020/09/29/shataean-kelly-levi-huffine-aurora-police-video-released-woman-struggling-back-patrol-car/">Aurora's chief said bodycam video appears to show one of her former officers, Levi Huffine, "punishing" a female prisoner.</a>]]></content:encoded>

These two comrades showed immense bravery in coming and speaking out against the injustice and cruelty of the criminal justice system, which they’ve now experienced firsthand. Joel would have absolutely been there too if he didn...'t have to be out of town! </p><p> Despite the incredibly difficult experience of going through jail and facing the upcoming battle to drop the over 30 serious charges that these organizers collectively face, they have not been intimidated by the repressive and violent forces of DPD, APD, and the 18th and 17th district attorneys. Their resolve has only been made stronger against the injustice that they and all prisoners and victims of police violence face. </p><p> Lillian spoke about the meaning of solidarity, telling the crowd how Eliza told her lawyer that if bond was posted for her before Lillian, she would insist on staying in jail despite the horrible torturous conditions she faced until Lillian was released too. </p><p> Eliza spoke of the need to continue the struggle against police terror now more than ever, saying "Let it be known - they wouldn't come after us if this movement didn't SCARE them!" </p><p> The battle to drop the charges is only beginning and everyone in the movement must come together in solidarity at this time to challenge an enemy with more resources but not more numbers, an enemy that uses the power of violence but is no match for the power of the people! </p><p> In the words of Assata Shakur: “We must love and support one another, we have nothing to lose but our chains!”</p><p> And in the words of Lillian House: “Our determination is so much greater than our fear. Our solidarity is so much greater than the repression. I have never felt more confident that we have what it takes to go the distance.
