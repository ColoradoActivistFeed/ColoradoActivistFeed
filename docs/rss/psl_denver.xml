In many ways, the current “automation revolution” is similar to the introduction of machines in the Industrial Revolution, which radically changed capitalist societies by amplifying inequality, creating a permanent unemployed class that Marxists call the industrial reserve army, and intensified colonialism.</p><p> Today’s automation revolution will similarly transform the landscape of labor, as robotics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning make the automation of vast swaths of complex jobs possible.</p><p> The rise of automation will accelerate the growing inequality that we see today, where the three richest people in the U.S.–Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett–own as much wealth as the bottom half of the country’s population. Capitalism is a hopelessly outdated system, which has only preserved itself through violence.</p><p> We have witnessed the ability of socialism to thrive under far more difficult circumstances.

Hampton was just 21 years old, but his life was rich in struggle.</p><p> Hampton was a community-builder. He brokered a nonaggression pact between Chicago’s most powerful street gangs, urging them to turn their anger and guns around on their oppressors, not on one another. He created the Rainbow Coalition, a class-conscious and multi-racial alliance.</p><p> On December 4th 1969, the Chica...go PD drugged Chairman Fred, stormed his apartment and executed him in his sleep, along with Panther leader Mark Clark. Fred’s wife and son somehow survived the volley of 99 bullets. It was a military style invasion and execution.</p><p> This was not an isolated instance. This was US government policy.<br /> Hampton’s murder was part of a pattern of police raids, false imprisonment and executions of Black Panthers. COINTELPRO documents proved that assassination of Black leaders was among its aims. Fred Hampton and the Black Panther Party had to be eliminated simply because they had touched upon capitalism’s greatest weakness—the decisiveness and strength that a multi-national movement has in a battle against this system.</p><p> The Black Panther Party arose from the struggles of the African American people, historically the most oppressed and exploited group in the United States. They symbolized hope and received the greatest affection. They attributed Black oppression to the capitalist system, and dared to pick up arms against the state. The militancy and defiance of these young revolutionaries deeply impacted the Civil Rights and socialist movements.</p><p> Hampton and the Black Panthers believed all would benefit if the banner of the struggle against racism and national oppression was taken up by the white masses as their own. Hampton knew that it was possible to smash the racial barriers created by capitalism to divide and conquer the working class. His confidence was based on the strong belief that this system provides a motive for all to unite and engage in revolutionary struggle.</p><p> Long live the memory of Fred Hampton and the Black Panther Party!</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1098584813927341">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/pcb.1098584813927341/1098583950594094/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/130157059_1098583953927427_6814982066463741412_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=X634TiZ_tCMAX_EgLql&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=cfea714765c6842e57ffdb3ad11d5d23&oe=5FF7A904" alt="Image may contain: 1 person, text that says 'FRED HAMPTON 1948-1969 "If you dare to struggle, you dare to win.
