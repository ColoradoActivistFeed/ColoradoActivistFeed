They are thus encouraging the internal destabilization of the largest of the Antilles, promoted by power circles and other sectors in the United States.</p><p> The actions undertaken in the cyberspace classify without any exaggeration as true media terrorism, inciting to violate public order, to commit outrages against the authorities; to lynch, attack and loot the most diverse institutions, and even urging to injure citizens of recognized social and revolutionary commitment in their homes.</p><p> As forcefully denounced by the Cuban ministry of Foreign Relations, the loutish actions of last Sunday, July 11 were orchestrated through tags and accounts using varied and complex computerized algorithms created outside Cuba, particularly in Miami, New York, Argentina and Spain.</p><p> The central purpose is no other than to overthrow the Cuban Revolution, example of heroic resistance during more than 60 years and inspiration for millions of people throughout the planet.</p><p> This time, the well-known bullies and those who have never raised their voices to condemn the criminal economic, commercial, and financial blockade imposed against our people appear as alleged “saviors” of the citizens, spreading to all four cardinal points campaigns of humanitarian intervention and corridors to send supplies to the archipelago. It is needless to say that such plots are unacceptable to a free, sovereign, independent nation that will never yield in the face of the imperial attacks, whatever their nature may be.</p><p> The sole and true claim that all worthy people in the world should endorse is the immediate lifting of that blockade, which pretends to suffocate the noble and solidary Cuban people. As if the inherent cruelty dating from its initial enforcement was not sufficient, the blockade was reinforced with more than 240 draconian measures by President Donald Trump that are still in force under the present US Administration headed by Joe Biden. Such behavior is even more genocidal in times when all humankind endures the blows caused by covid-19.</p><p> The Cuban people is conscious of the challenges it faces. It is likewise certain that it will only be possible to control the pandemic and grow in economic efficiency as priorities under the conditions of the socialist revolution it developed with great sacrifice and spilling of blood since January 1, 1959.</p><p> It is difficult to find any other place in the world where there has been more done to respect and dignify the people’s lives. From San Antonio to Maisí, in this green alligator that rises in the Caribbean Sea, no human being has ever been disappeared, tortured, or humiliated. In a continent where there are hundreds of professionals of the media assassinated every year, not one of them has been, or will be, Cuban.</p><p> We are a hard-working country whose daily aspiration is to give its citizens a general, comprehensive culture that will enhance their humanity in midst of a global panorama that, unfortunately, is often characterized by hatred, violence and the use of force. We will not cease to work with this purpose.</p><p> We Cubans, model defenders of peace as one of the supreme universal values, also know that these maneuvers to present an ungovernable Cuba that only exists in the cyberspace are a threat to peace in the world and in our hemisphere. That is why we call upon our friends and honest people worldwide, beyond their political and ideological standpoints, to condemn with determination this new plan that is being orchestrated against a land that is proud of its past and that will not renounce to construct its future.</p><p> The message we are sending you transmits the spirit of equanimity and the most genuine conviction that characterizes the people we represent. Each attempt to carry out soft coups, color revolutions, or any other subversive scheme designed by the hawks of war will crash against the moral shield of a nation that is ready to sink in the sea before betraying the glory it has lived.</p><p> Down with manipulation, hatred and lies! Long live world peace!</p><p> Cuba will overcome!</p><p> Presidency of the Cuban Peace Movement Havana,</p><p> July 15, 2021</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See more</a>]]></content:encoded>

The U.S. Peace Council Stands in Solidarity <br /> with the Cuban Revolution!</p><p> U.S. Peace Council Statement<br /> July 14, 2021</p>...<p> The recent protests in Cuba over deteriorating conditions have a material basis that cannot be dismissed. No matter how heroic a people may be, socialism must provide for their material needs. The U.S. blockade of Cuba is designed precisely to thwart that and to discredit socialism in Cuba and anywhere else where oppressed people try to better their lot. </p><p> Cuban President Díaz-Canel warned in 2019: </p><p> “The US began to intensify a series of restrictive measures, a tightening of the blockade, of financial persecution against the energy sector with the aim of suffocating our economy and expecting that this would provoke the desired massive social outbreak, which sows the possibilities for the entire ideological campaign that it has done, to be able to call for humanitarian intervention that ends in military intervention and interference, and that affects the rights, sovereignty and independence of all peoples.” </p><p> Whatever the alleged problems of Cuba, it is being attacked precisely because that small island nation promises a humane alternative to the decaying neoliberal order of present-day capitalism and its pending crisis of legitimacy. If a critical spotlight is needed, it is not on how the Cubans with so little should have done better, but on how the imperialists with so much must be defeated. This is especially the case of those of us privileged enough to take for granted potable water coming out of a tap and 24/7 access to electricity, which is not the condition of much of humanity. </p><p> From Eisenhower to the present, U.S. policy on Cuba has been an unbroken continuation of economic sanctions, active support of regime-change activities, and occupation of Guantánamo. All illusions should be disabused that somehow a change in the Oval Office occupant would bring about a more humane U.S. imperialism. The specific tactics may vary from president to president, but the goal of strangling socialism has always been the guiding principle. </p><p> The cold, calculating cruelty of U.S. capitalism was exposed when it seized on the COVID crisis as an opportunity to further punish the Cuban people with increased illegal sanctions imposed by the Trump administration and continued by its successor. </p><p> Despite feints to the left on the campaign trail, Biden has, instead of discontinuing Trump’s deportation policy, intensified it. Instead of opening dialogue with the democratically elected government of Venezuela, Biden has embraced the puppet-president Guaidó in the name of “sovereignty.” And instead of accepting the prerogative to the Nicaraguan people to choose their own leaders, Biden has slapped new illegal sanctions aimed at undermining their upcoming elections in the name of “democracy.” Trump’s “Troika of Tyranny” — targeting Cuba (with 243 new sanctions), Nicaragua, and Venezuela — is Biden’s as well … and our challenge. </p><p> Since its triumph six decades ago, the Cuban Revolution has of necessity resisted the assaults of the U.S. and its allies. That Cuba has successfully not only persisted but has been an international model for the accomplishments of socialism does not mean that it will always be so. The Cubans can resist, but it is us, who — in the words of Che Guevara — live in “the belly of the beast,” who must defend the revolution by ending the siege against it. This is not a time for complacency. The intensified U.S. interference in Cuba is a wakeup call for greater efforts at solidarity. </p><p> We call upon all supporters of peace, peoples’ sovereignty and social justice in the U.S. and around the world to join hands to put an end to U.S. criminal, anti-human sanctions and illegal interventions in the affairs of Cuba and other sovereign nations. </p><p> The U.S. Peace Council stands in solidarity with the Cuban Revolution! </p><p> — Hands off Cuba!<br /> — End All Criminal Sanctions Against Cuba and other Sovereign Nations!</p><p> U.S. Peace Council<br /> July 14, 2021</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See more</a>]]></content:encoded>

Particularly during the recent period, and in conditions of the global pandemic, Cuba is being prevented through new measures and sanctions to purchase and import medicines and the raw materials needed to produce them, as well as other critical hospital supplies.</p><p> While acknowledging the suffering of the Cuban people, the WPC underlines in the strongest way its rejection to any actions of interference and subversive actions which aim to impose “regime change” by paid elements and mercenaries as we have observed with “Color Revolutions” in other parts of the world. The Cuban people know too well that the imperialists have never stopped the war against their country, regardless the rotating methods or the changing residents of the White House. These criminal and inhuman policies are being helped by its imperialist allies in NATO and the European Union, and by their agents inside Cuba and in Florida who are now demanding open intervention under the pretext, once again, of “humanitarianism”.</p><p> We denounce the cynical attempts of those forces who cause the suffering by political and economical sanctions and blockade in the first place, and then hypocritically plead for the “poor Cuban people” who have to be taught “democracy and human rights”. Cuba particularly has given lessons of solidarity and dignity many times over, since the triumph of the Revolution in 1959. During the current Covid-19 pandemic, the island of the Revolution has continued to render selfless internationalist aid to poor and oppressed peoples in need around the world, and to develop its own vaccines, despite the extremely difficult conditions it faces..</p><p> We express our indignation against the imperialist plans to create social discontent and direct it against the sovereign Cuban government. The achievements of Socialist Cuba constitute an example and source of inspiration for the peoples of Latin America and the world.  </p><p> The WPC stands in solidarity with the heroic people of Cuba and its Revolution! We demand the immediate lifting of the blockade and of all sanctions against Cuba!</p><p> End to the imperialist provocations!<br /> Hands off Cuba!</p><p> The WPC Secretariat — Athens, 12th July 2021</p><p> World Peace Council<br /> Athens/Greece<br /> <a href="http://www.wpc-in.org/">www.wpc-in.org</a><br /> Edit</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See more</a>]]></content:encoded>
