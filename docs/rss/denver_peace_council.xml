The real reason behind this act is to force Iran, by means of military action, into accepting to participate in a new round of Nuclear Deal negotiations on the basis of specific U.S. demands. We can only expect that such military actions will continue, and even intensify, so long as Iran refuses to submit to U.S. pressures.</p><p> What U.S. is asking from Iran is not limited to the nuclear issue. All US administrations, from George W. Bush administration to the present, have been demanding from Iran to stop its resistance against U.S. imperialistic plans for total domination of the Middle East. The real issue is Iran’s policy of resistance and its ability to mobilize regional forces against U.S. and Israeli aggressions, and Biden’s actions are nothing but the continuation of the same imperialist policies of his predecessors for the Middle East.</p><p> We call upon all supporters of peace, justice, and international law to raise their voices against Biden Administration’s aggressive policies against Iran, as such policies are bound to lead to more war, death and destruction for the peoples of the Middle East, and waste of the American people’s much needed resources for solving their health and economic problems in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p> We call upon Biden Administration to halt all U.S. military and economic wars against the peoples of the world.</p><p> Executive Committee <br /> of the U.S. Peace Council</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

She was questioned for three hours, and her mobile devices and pass codes were confiscated and passed on to the FBI. She was then arrested by the RCMP on an extradition warrant issued by a U.S. court, and has been placed under house arrest ever since while the extradition order wends its way through the courts.</p><p> The arrest and detention of Ms. Wanzhou is unprecedented in international legal practice. She is charged with having fraudulently misrepresented Huawei’s business ties with Iran, in violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran – sanctions which were unilaterally and illegally imposed by the Trump White House, and which are opposed by the overwhelming majority of the international community, including Canada and Washington’s other NATO allies.</p><p> Dozens of other countries snubbed U.S. requests to arrest and extradite Ms. Wanzhou – countries which also have extradition agreements with the U.S. They did so because the ‘TRUMP’ed up case against Ms. Wanzhou is politically motivated and without any legal basis. President Trump himself admitted publicly that he was using Meng’s detention as a “bargaining chip” to secure a favourable trade agreement with China!</p><p> To its shame, Canada was the only country to spinelessly submit to Washington’s groundless demands.</p><p> Furthermore, the arrest/detention process itself was seriously flawed, and denied Ms. Wanzhou’s civil liberties as a permanent resident of Canada. As recent testimony before the courts has revealed, Canadian authorities secretly conspired with U.S. intelligence agencies to seize ‘evidence’ in violation of her constitutional rights.</p><p> The unjustified detention and threatened extradition of Meng Wanzhou has caused a grave deterioration in relations between Canada and the People’s Republic of China. It has damaged trade and investment relations between the two countries (China is Canada’s 2nd-largest trading partner), affected academic and cultural exchanges, and further contributed to Sinophobia and racism against Chinese and other Asian Canadians.</p><p> This sordid “Cold War”-style episode is totally reprehensible. Even though Ms. Wanzhou has committed no crime in Canada, she has been taken as a political hostage, with Canada’s collusion, in order to extort economic benefit for U.S. business interests at the expense of Chinese high-tech competitors like Huawei. It is in violation of both Canadian and international law, has further aggravated global tensions, and has seriously harmed Canada-China bilateral relations.</p><p> This two-year long saga must end now, with Ms. Wanzhou’s immediate release. The repeated claims of the Trudeau government that it cannot interfere with the “rule of law” are completely bogus. The federal Minister of Justice has the legal right to step in at any stage of the extradition process to drop the case, and to free Meng. The Extradition Act includes a specific provision granting the Minister the power to intervene in an extradition at any point during the judicial phase. What is lacking is the political will to do so.</p><p>  If Canada had a truly independent foreign policy – one based on peace, cooperation and respect for international law – this injustice would be rectified overnight! </p><p> The Canadian Peace Congress demands that the Canadian government bring an immediate end to this farce. The campaign to free Ms. Wanzhou is growing everywhere. We urge all democratically-minded and progressive organizations and individuals across Canada to speak out against this senseless and harmful injustice.</p><p> Free Meng Wanzhou NOW!</p><p> Say NO to a new Cold War against China!</p><p> Demand a truly independent Canadian foreign policy based on peace, disarmament, and respect for the UN Charter and international law!</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>
