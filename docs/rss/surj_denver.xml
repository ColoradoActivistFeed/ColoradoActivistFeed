With the entire world hyper-focused on racial injustice white supremacists have doubled down in full confidence that they will be protected by the justice department above all else. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BoulderDA/">Boulder DA's Office, 20th Judicial District - DA Michael Dougherty</a> is functioning as a vehicle of white supremacy in his refusal to drop these trumped up charges against this sister after years of enduring vile behaviors like the use of racial slurs against her children. We are in fierce support of Mrs. Jeweldine Kastman and her family, and we demand a full dismissal of all charges against them. Call Da Dougherty’s office and demand he dismiss this case today and everyday until it is done!

Our core values demand we take personal responsibility for denouncing the kind of discrimination, harassment, and racism Mrs. Kastman has experienced in Boulder County. Further, we believe the District Attorney has a responsibility to the public to reexamine her case through an unbiased lens. We believe that acknowledgment and reconsideration of the implicit biases in this case should lead to the conclusion that the interests of justice require that Mrs. Kastman's case be dismissed.<br /> Mrs. Kastman moved to Colorado just a couple of years ago having never experienced the kind of blatant racism she would encounter from her neighbors here. Through constant harassment of herself and her children, having the police called on her family for just being outside their home, and incessant racial slurs repeatedly directed at them no protective measures by law enforcement were ever taken on the Kastman family’s behalf. In fact, on one occasion Mrs. Kastman’s husband, for attempting to stand up to the neighbors' persecution, was charged with harassment. Unsurprisingly, Mrs. Kastman's husband, a white man, received a deferred prosecution agreement on the harassment charge, a privilege that has not been extended to Mrs. Kastman.<br /> Mrs. Kastman, fed up with her family being subjected to targeted harassment indirectly responded to this discrimination out of frustration. The neighbors again reported her, and she was charged with a Class 3 Felony for Witness Retaliation, which carries anywhere from 4 - 12 years in prison followed by 5 years of parole. Jeweldine does not have a criminal history. Despite her lack of criminal history, the Longmont Police Department bypassed the opportunity to issue a summons to Mrs. Kastman and instead chose to arrest Mrs. Kastman in front of her children.<br /> The DA of Boulder County, Michael Dougherty, is only willing to reduce the charges if Mrs. Kastman pleads guilty to harassment or disorderly conduct. The white men who have habitually berated and antagonized this family in front of their home have never been charged. After years of living in constant fear, and after her husband was charged with harassment for standing up to racists threatening their family, Jeweldine Kastman is being ordered to sacrifice her freedom or plead guilty to a crime she did not commit. In September of 2019, DA Michael Dougherty’s office announced their commitment to prosecute instances of bias and hate motivated crimes “to the full extent of the law.” How is it that just one year later we’re being called to action against an obvious display of bias and hate in Boulder County that is being enabled by the DA himself? We do not stand for this. We stand firmly in support of Mrs. Jeweldine Kastman and her family, and we demand a full dismissal of this case and that the harassment conviction her husband received for verbally defending his family be overturned immediately. We demand that DA Michael Dougherty honor his commitment to the people of Boulder County and interrupt this perpetual cycle of bias in our justice department. This family had law enforcement sworn to serve and protect them weaponized against them at a time<br /> when they feared for their lives. We demand justice.

The current contract allows DPD to lock in a $5M raise in 2022 while no other city employees are allowed to collectively bargain AND face drastic cuts to their agency budgets. The 2021 budget includes minor increases to programs designed as alternatives to policing (STAR, etc.) with funding from external sources – these budgetary increases did not decrease the DPD budget in any way.</p><p> Tell your councilperson to stand firm and say NO to this contract!</p><p> [image: <br /> -Ortega, At Large 720-337-7713 Ortegaatlarge&#064;denvergov.org &#064;OrtegaAtLarge  <br /> -Kniech, At Large 720-337-7712 kniechatlarge&#064;denvergov.org. &#064;KniechAtLarge   <br /> -Sandoval D1 720-337-7701 districtone&#064;denvergov.org &#064;sandovalcd1   <br /> -Flynn D2 720-337-2222 kevin.flynn&#064;denvergov.org. <br /> -Torres D3 720-337-3333 jamie.torres&#064;denvergov.org &#064;TorresDenver3    <br /> -Black D4 720-337-4444 kendra.black&#064;denvergov.org <br /> -Sawyer D5 720-337-5555 denvercouncil5&#064;denvergov.org &#064;DenverCouncil5<br /> -Kashmann D6 720-337-6666 paul.kashmann&#064;denvergov.org &#064;CouncilmanPaul6    <br /> -Clark D7 720-337-7777 jolon.clark&#064;denvergov.org &#064;LuckyDistrict7    <br /> -Herndon D8 720-337-8888 christopher.herndon&#064;denvergov.org &#064;ChrisjHerndon  <br /> -CdeBaca D9 720-337-7709 district9&#064;denvergov.org &#064;CandiCdeBacaD9  <br /> -Hinds D10 720-337-7710 chris.hinds&#064;denvergov.org &#064;DenverPerfect10  <br /> -Gilmore D11 720-337-7711 stacie.gilmore&#064;denvergov.org &#064;SGilmoreDist11]</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SURJDenver/posts/2752426255031530">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/SURJDenver/photos/a.1639607076313459/2752415475032608/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s526x395/125378475_2752415478365941_3704203270620765164_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=6isbFouofjgAX_VxNZC&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&tp=7&oh=0fd39ccc917232398ff5e7de0b84e255&oe=6018D35E" alt="No photo description available." width="500" height="385" caption="No photo description available." /></a>]]></content:encoded>
