Some of our loved ones will tell the myth of the first Thanksgiving. Some of us will participate in the myth telling. Some will cringe and say nothing. Some will wonder what can be said or done. Tomorrow, the United American Indians of New England will have a 50th National Day of Mourning to commemorate the ability to thrive in insane circumstances, and mourn ancestors and the reality that his...tory is repeating itself even now. <a href="https://time.com/5911943/thanksgiving-wampanoag/?amp=true">https://time.com/5911943/thanksgiving-wampanoag/?amp=true</a>. </p><p> On their site <a href="http://www.uaine.org/">http://www.uaine.org/</a>, they talk about the day and post the doc "How you can still support the 2020 National Day of Mourning even if you can't come to Plymouth," which has some great suggestions for sharing this perspective and dispelling myths with loved ones and on social media. </p><p> To support locally, please check out the incredible work of Four Winds American Indian Council and the Denver Indian Center and please donate to their organization and their food bank, which has been hit hard by the pandemic. <a href="https://www.denverindiancenter.org/our-food-bank">https://www.denverindiancenter.org/our-food-bank</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SURJDenver/posts/2763426927264796">See More</a><a href="https://time.com/5911943/thanksgiving-wampanoag/?amp=true.">Many Wampanoag hoped that the 400th anniversary of the Mayflower landing would be a galvanizing event to remind people that they still exist<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQGYOrenS67kVsjN&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.time.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F11%2Fthanksgiving-wampanoag-1.jpg%3Fquality%3D85%26crop%3D0px%252C164px%252C2400px%252C1256px%26resize%3D1200%252C628%26strip&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQGza7vLbMJAU2Ni" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>time.com</p><p>Tribe Who Fed the Pilgrims Strives for Survival Amid New Epidemic</p>Many Wampanoag hoped that the 400th anniversary of the Mayflower landing would be a galvanizing event to remind people that they still exist<a href="https://time.com/5911943/thanksgiving-wampanoag/?amp=true.">Many Wampanoag hoped that the 400th anniversary of the Mayflower landing would be a galvanizing event to remind people that they still exist</a>]]></content:encoded>

In the midst of an uprising of global proportions fueled by the worldwide demanding of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/justiceforblacklives">#justiceforBlacklives</a>, the justice syste...m is still being weaponized against us in real time. With the entire world hyper-focused on racial injustice white supremacists have doubled down in full confidence that they will be protected by the justice department above all else. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BoulderDA/">Boulder DA's Office, 20th Judicial District - DA Michael Dougherty</a> is functioning as a vehicle of white supremacy in his refusal to drop these trumped up charges against this sister after years of enduring vile behaviors like the use of racial slurs against her children. We are in fierce support of Mrs. Jeweldine Kastman and her family, and we demand a full dismissal of all charges against them. Call Da Dougherty’s office and demand he dismiss this case today and everyday until it is done!

Our core values demand we take personal responsibility for denouncing the kind of discrimination, harassment, and racism Mrs. Kastman has experienced in Boulder County. Further, we believe the District Attorney has a responsibility to the public to reexamine her case through an unbiased lens. We believe that acknowledgment and reconsideration of the implicit biases in this case should lead to the conclusion that the interests of justice require that Mrs. Kastman's case be dismissed.<br /> Mrs. Kastman moved to Colorado just a couple of years ago having never experienced the kind of blatant racism she would encounter from her neighbors here. Through constant harassment of herself and her children, having the police called on her family for just being outside their home, and incessant racial slurs repeatedly directed at them no protective measures by law enforcement were ever taken on the Kastman family’s behalf. In fact, on one occasion Mrs. Kastman’s husband, for attempting to stand up to the neighbors' persecution, was charged with harassment. Unsurprisingly, Mrs. Kastman's husband, a white man, received a deferred prosecution agreement on the harassment charge, a privilege that has not been extended to Mrs. Kastman.<br /> Mrs. Kastman, fed up with her family being subjected to targeted harassment indirectly responded to this discrimination out of frustration. The neighbors again reported her, and she was charged with a Class 3 Felony for Witness Retaliation, which carries anywhere from 4 - 12 years in prison followed by 5 years of parole. Jeweldine does not have a criminal history. Despite her lack of criminal history, the Longmont Police Department bypassed the opportunity to issue a summons to Mrs. Kastman and instead chose to arrest Mrs. Kastman in front of her children.<br /> The DA of Boulder County, Michael Dougherty, is only willing to reduce the charges if Mrs. Kastman pleads guilty to harassment or disorderly conduct. The white men who have habitually berated and antagonized this family in front of their home have never been charged. After years of living in constant fear, and after her husband was charged with harassment for standing up to racists threatening their family, Jeweldine Kastman is being ordered to sacrifice her freedom or plead guilty to a crime she did not commit. In September of 2019, DA Michael Dougherty’s office announced their commitment to prosecute instances of bias and hate motivated crimes “to the full extent of the law.” How is it that just one year later we’re being called to action against an obvious display of bias and hate in Boulder County that is being enabled by the DA himself? We do not stand for this. We stand firmly in support of Mrs. Jeweldine Kastman and her family, and we demand a full dismissal of this case and that the harassment conviction her husband received for verbally defending his family be overturned immediately. We demand that DA Michael Dougherty honor his commitment to the people of Boulder County and interrupt this perpetual cycle of bias in our justice department. This family had law enforcement sworn to serve and protect them weaponized against them at a time<br /> when they feared for their lives. We demand justice.

We also hold close the reality that if we are to continue the fight for racial justice, we must work harder than ever to hold the Biden-Harris administration, Congress, the Supreme Court, our state and local go...vernments, our neighbors, and our families accountable to the leadership of Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities, most notably the Black women and femmes who, despite their tireless work toward liberation, will be the most adversely affected by harmful policy decisions inevitably to come. </p><p> It will also take a tremendous amount of effort to work toward repairing the damage that centuries of racism has caused in this country, let alone that which has been concentrated within the past four years. Our work won’t get easier, it will just look different. We are as committed as always to amplifying the work of Black, Brown, and Indigenous community leaders, and we will never stop striving toward a more antiracist world. We hope you’ll do the same.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SURJDenver/posts/2746933515580804">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/SURJDenver/photos/a.1639086463032187/2746933198914169/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/123774788_2746933202247502_2175269602906251518_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=2&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=jp5qDpa_qUsAX_urdIz&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=e8f1f840ddff11f69c78c77e25d225ef&oe=600EB3DF" alt="No photo description available." width="500" height="420" caption="No photo description available." /></a>]]></content:encoded>
