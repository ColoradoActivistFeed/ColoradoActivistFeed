Hancock</a>).</p><p> A recent study by the municipal public defender's office found that 30% of the people caught in the revolving door of the municipal court system are Black (Denver is 10% Black), and that 38% of total municipal court cases involve unhoused people charged with minor, nonviolent violations directly related to homelessness.</p><p> Racial justice is intersectional justice - please continue to support organizations like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/coloradodashr/">Denver Alliance for Street Health Response</a> who work with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/">Denver Homeless Out Loud</a> to ensure that our unhoused neighbors have what they need to survive this winter. <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/supporting-dashr039s-community-response">https://www.gofundme.com/f/supporting-dashr039s-community-r…</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SURJDenver/posts/2692175781056578">See More</a><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/supporting-dashr039s-community-response">Denver Alliance for Street Health Response (DASHR) is an organization focused o… Vinnie Cervantes needs your support for Supporting DASHR's Community Response<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDTNoUoaYJwrWBv&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net%2F48934810_1592509035270542_r.jpeg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQAuCSMb-QBmBKDq" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>gofundme.com</p><p>Supporting DASHR's Community Response, organized by Vinnie Cervantes</p>Denver Alliance for Street Health Response (DASHR) is an organization focused o… Vinnie Cervantes needs your support for Supporting DASHR's Community Response<a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/supporting-dashr039s-community-response">Denver Alliance for Street Health Response (DASHR) is an organization focused o… Vinnie Cervantes needs your support for Supporting DASHR's Community Response</a>]]></content:encoded>

Denver will go from sweltering heat with a high of 93 degrees on Monday to 34 degrees and snowing on Tuesday.

Not only is it environmentally wasteful and costly to taxpayers, but it condemns folks on the street to suffering and possibly death. Folks can’t take their tents and sleeping bags into shelters either, and surely in the middle of a global pandemic, we might understand why folks would rather be outside than crammed in shelters. </p><p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/">Denver Homeless Out Loud</a> is collecting sleeping bags, tents, tarps, and other survival gear at 2260 California until 5pm today and will distribute to folks in the area (contact info&#064;denverhomelessoutloud.org for questions). DASHR will be supporting folks in the Cap Hill area tomorrow by handing out hand warmers, socks, and supporting unhoused folks with our street medics. We will also be coordinating with the STAR van for crises that are beyond our street team.

We'd like to echo that call - let’s flood their registration process or let them know directly why trainings like this are dangerous and problematic and should be called off by emailing christie.mochoruk&#064;denvergov.org.</p><p> Why is this training a bad thing?</p>...<p> A department that has demonstrated again and again that it has no respect for the lives of our BIPOC neighbors, people experiencing homelessness, or protesters has no business teaching the community how to protect itself.</p><p> There is no way the racism baked into policing cannot replicate itself in how they teach neighbors to spy on each other (they can’t even keep it out of their logo - a menacing, featureless image of a "suspicious" black man).</p><p> The “intruder” mentality built by Neighborhood Watch programs, when combined with racial bias, results in vigilante murders like that of Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery.</p><p> Neighborhood Watch teaches communities to fear each other, to watch for “outsiders”, to surveil each other, and to rely on the threat of police violence to feel “safe”. True safety comes from communication, empathy, and mutual aid.

I’m not talking about it’s close cousin white guilt. Penitenti...al whiteness differs from white guilt in that it is vocal. It’s more than a feeling...it falls over itself to outperform and out woke every other white “ally.” </p><p> Penitential whiteness might look and sound desirable, but I can guarantee you that it absolutely is not. It is exhausting. </p><p> Penitential whiteness is a paradox. </p><p> It demands labor by performing labor. Instead of lending quiet support behind the scenes, it is loud and in front. It needs the cookies and badges from Black people. If no cookies are given, there is an assumption that something went wrong, and so the penitential white person become insecure and needs to make sure they’re still a “good person.” </p><p> It centers itself by de-centering whiteness. Penitential whiteness makes sure that everyone knows that they are not in the center by telling everyone that they aren’t in the center. They are in the center of all of the fe-centering. </p><p> Penitential whiteness does everything at full steam. If it’s calling out other white folks penitent white folks will be the loudest and most persistent. If it is if it’s raising awareness, you can expect a full, scripted pitch. If it is showing up, it will be the first one there and the last to leave. </p><p> Penitential whiteness, on the surface, might seem like a healthy expression of allyship (or whatever y’all calling it right now). The difference between being a healthy co-conspirator and a penitential white individual is about posture. Penitential white folks can do good work, but that good work is rooted in relieving the pressure to prove their goodness rather than in the liberation of others. </p><p> Beware and be wary of penitential whiteness. It’s not a good look. At the end of the day, penitential whiteness does more harm than good because the “work” of a penitential person of whiteness is rooted in their zeal to prove themselves. </p><p> Penitential whiteness does not combat white supremacy, it reinforces it by—once again—making people of whiteness the hero of their own narratives. The narrative, in this case, is being The Best Ally That Ever Allied and sucking all of the air (and liberation) out of the room. </p><p> I don’t expect everyone to understand or agree with this word. But I hope that it will at least get folks thinking about how they approach the work of antiracism.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

The program provides a more appropriate and more humane approach to crisis involving homelessness, mental health, and substance use. The CAHOOTS program answers about one-fifth of the 911 calls in Eugene and saves the city on average $8 million per year. DASHR’s efforts, alongside other community groups and partners, resulted in the launch of the new STAR (Support Team Assisted Response) pilot program in Denver on June 1st. </p><p> Since January, DASHR has also been working with members of Aurora’s City Council to explore building a model similar to CAHOOTS. “Aurora currently has a co-responder model, but we know that a police presence can escalate a situation,“ said Councilwoman Allison Hiltz who chairs the public safety committee on council. “In looking at other models, we are better able to prioritize our community’s needs and rethink how we deliver mental health care.” She plans to present a brief update on their progress at a committee meeting on August 27, with hopes for a more complete proposal in the near future. </p><p> Natalia Marshall, whose uncle Michael Marshall was killed in the Denver jail noted that this type of response could prevent similar things from happening. “My uncle Michael had schizophrenia and when he called police to report his bible as stolen, he was met by police officers instead of mental health professionals who brought him to the jail, which led to his death.” She adds that he needed mental health services not jail. Natalia is an Aurora resident and activist for alternatives to police and criminal justice reform.</p><p> DASHR strongly believes in creating alternatives to policing, jail, and the prison industrial complex more generally. “I believe we’re in a critical moment where the ideas we’ve been fighting to achieve for years are finally getting the attention and consideration they’ve always deserved,” said Vinnie Cervantes, Organizing Director of DASHR. “It’s important that our solutions are truly alternatives to systemic harm and that they are led by the community” DASHR is committed to helping facilitate community involvement in the programs.</p><p> About DASHR<br /> Denver Alliance for Street Health Response (DASHR) is a coalition of groups and individuals who create and support community- based responses to crisis and conflict, as well as forge new narratives of public health and safety.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>
