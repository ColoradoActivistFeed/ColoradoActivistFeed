She’s raising money to hire a lawyer for her son’s immigration case once it gets closer to his court date. You can support here: <a href="https://solidaritymeals.paperform.co/">https://solidaritymeals.paperform.co.</a> Unlike in criminal proceedings, people in immigration court have no right to a lawyer, and so anyone who cannot afford one must represent themselves. There are some local stopgap programs, such as the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, which provides ...free legal services to people in immigrant detention, and the Denver Immigrant Legal Services Fund, which pays immigration attorneys to represent people who would otherwise be unable to obtain a lawyer (disappointingly, the Aurora City Council recently voted not to establish a similar immigrant legal defense fund).

While this bill positions itself to fund programs like what we've been working on with multiple cities across Colorado and even across the country, the funding is restricted to law enforcement agencies and there is other language that would further harm our efforts. Taking Denver and Aurora for example, two cities we've worked with that have either launched or approved non-police models, neither city would theoretically be eligible for this funding for non-police models. Denver's STAR lives under Denver Department of Public Health and Environment and Aurora's program will live under a director position at the municipal level, outside of the police department. If these two programs are influencing this legislation, then the bill has fallen short of even supporting those cities, as well as others as there is tremendous nuance to each city we've worked to create programs with.</p><p> We ask our supporters and community to join us in opposing this bill as it has been written and invite folks to testify. You can do so virtually by signing up at <a href="https://www2.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2021A/commsumm.nsf/signIn.xsp">https://www2.leg.state.co.us/…/CLIC…/commsumm.nsf/signIn.xsp</a>. At the very least, we ask that folks submit written testimony or contact their elected officials with the following demands: </p><p> - Funding being open to entities that are not strictly law enforcement. If this bill is to support community partnerships, then funding must be open to the actual community partners.</p><p> - Equal or majority funding going towards non-police models versus co-responder models. There should be a distinction between the two as they are not the same and while there has been some positive impact from co-responder programs, we have heard from social workers that they are often inhibited from doing their jobs by the commanding presence of law enforcement.</p><p> - Remove the required $2 million set aside for law enforcement mental health as that would leave almost nothing for crisis response programs.</p><p> - Finally, if legislators are to work to support local programs that are community partnerships, then there should be more due diligence in engaging with the municipalities and community organizations doing the work before moving this bill forward in any form. </p><p> We believe that the state should help municipalities work to create non-police models that we've been working on, especially as cities have continued to note funding as a barrier. However, we reject the limited confines of this particular bill and insist on more engagement from those working to introduce it.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

We are posting the link to the report here for the general public’s review. To briefly summarize, it finds that upon review the evidence shows that:</p>...<p> 1) Officers DID NOT have sufficient reason/cause to STOP Elijah McClain;<br /> 2) Officers DID NOT have sufficient reason/cause to FRISK Elijah McClain;<br /> 3) There was NOT SUFFICIENT CAUSE to support the PHYSICAL RESTRAINT of Elijah McClain;<br /> 4) The DECISION TO APPLY FORCE IN RESPONSE TO THE THREAT OR PERCEIVED THREAT that Elijah McClain reached for an officer’s gun during the struggle is NOT SUPPORTED BY THE EVIDENCE;<br /> 5) The record DOES NOT PROVIDE EVIDENCE of the officers’ perception of a threat that would justify consecutive carotid holds, which caused Elijah McClain to either partially or fully lose consciousness;<br /> 6) Officers’ assertions of the necessity of pain compliance techniques are IN CONTRAST to Elijah McClain’s audible statements while being restrained;<br /> 7) Aurora EMS DID NOT RENDER AID to Elijah McClain for several minutes after arrival and the body worn camera footage DOES NOT REFLECT any attempt by Aurora Fire to examine or question Elijah McClain before the administration of ketamine;<br /> 8.)THE DECISION TO ADMINISTER KETAMINE was made within 6 minutes of arrival when Aurora Fire deferred to the recommendation of officers WITHOUT MEANINGFUL OBSERVATION OR DIAGNOSTIC EXAMINATION;<br /> 9) Aurora EMS determined it was appropriate to administer ketamine to Elijah McClain despite the fact that HE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE OFFERING MEANINGFUL RESISTANCE in the presence of EMS personnel;<br /> 10) THE AMOUNT OF KETAMINE ADMINISTERED was based on a grossly inaccurate and inflated estimate of Elijah McClain’s weight, carrying a higher risk of sedation complications;<br /> 11) The Aurora PD’s AFTER-INCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS revealed SIGNIFICANT WEAKNESSES IN THE DEPARTMENT’S ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEMS, with investigative questioning that appeared designed to elicit specific exonerating “magic language” found in court rulings.<br /> <a href="https://www.auroragov.org/UserFiles/Servers/Server_1881137/File/News%20Items/Investigation%20Report%20and%20Recommendations%20(FINAL).pdf">https://www.auroragov.org/…/Investigation%20Report%20and%20…</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SURJDenver/posts/2829164437357711">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/SURJDenver/photos/a.1639607076313459/2829165054024316/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/152947677_2829165057357649_7873324528673537040_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=FAydXW8OXBEAX-pcgwo&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=cddfc432f94887adc5060aef3869893c&oe=608473DD" alt="May be an image of 1 person" width="500" height="282" caption="May be an image of 1 person" /></a>]]></content:encoded>
