We demand their immediate freedom and that the charges against them be dropped.</p><p> On Sept. 17, several protest leaders, including four members of the Party for Socialism and Liberation, were arrested in Denver, Colorado in a coordinated police attack. The org...anizers now face over 30 bogus charges including “kidnapping” and “inciting a riot,” and potentially years in prison. They were targeted because of their dedicated organizing efforts in recent months to denouncing the police murder of Elijah McClain in Aurora, Colorado.</p><p> The same District Attorney, Dave Young, who has refused to charge the police officers who murdered Elijah McClain, directed these felony arrests of the organizers who have been protesting against him. He is engaged in a corrupt abuse of his authority to silence his critics and the demands for racial justice, a declaration of war against the First Amendment.</p><p> This attack goes hand in hand with the assault on the anti-racist movement directed from the White House, from Governor’s mansions, and from local police departments around the country.</p><p> We understand that this can happen to any protester, who has used their voice to mobilize in the mass movement against racism in every single corner of the United States. We stand united against this attack on civil liberties and the ongoing movement for Black Lives.</p><p> Demands:<br /> Free the anti-racist organizers from jail immediately!<br /> Drop all the charges!<br /> Stop the assault on the movement and on free speech!<br /> In solidarity,<br /> Add your name here: <a href="https://www.pslweb.org/denverorgsolidarity">https://www.pslweb.org/denverorgsolidarity</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SURJDenver/posts/2706885716252251">See More</a><a href="https://www.pslweb.org/denverorgsolidarity">We are calling on all individuals and organizations who care about justice and free speech to unite in this fight to defend the protest movement, and free these Denver-area organizers.

Though an appeal to the state Supreme Court is in the works, this means that potentially for most of this winter, the criminal punishment system will deny our unhoused neighb...ors the basic human right to not only safe, affordable housing but to camp undisturbed without having their homes and property "swept" and stolen/trashed under the orders of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverdoti/">Denver Department of Transportation and Infrastructure</a> or the Denver Department of Public Health and Environment. (Let's be real, though - we know you're behind these orders, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/5280mayor/">Michael B. Hancock</a>).</p><p> A recent study by the municipal public defender's office found that 30% of the people caught in the revolving door of the municipal court system are Black (Denver is 10% Black), and that 38% of total municipal court cases involve unhoused people charged with minor, nonviolent violations directly related to homelessness.</p><p> Racial justice is intersectional justice - please continue to support organizations like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/coloradodashr/">Denver Alliance for Street Health Response</a> who work with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/">Denver Homeless Out Loud</a> to ensure that our unhoused neighbors have what they need to survive this winter. <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/supporting-dashr039s-community-response">https://www.gofundme.com/f/supporting-dashr039s-community-r…</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SURJDenver/posts/2692175781056578">See More</a><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/supporting-dashr039s-community-response">Denver Alliance for Street Health Response (DASHR) is an organization focused o… Vinnie Cervantes needs your support for Supporting DASHR's Community Response<img src="https://external.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDTNoUoaYJwrWBv&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net%2F48934810_1592509035270542_r.jpeg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQAuCSMb-QBmBKDq" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>gofundme.com</p><p>Supporting DASHR's Community Response, organized by Vinnie Cervantes</p>Denver Alliance for Street Health Response (DASHR) is an organization focused o… Vinnie Cervantes needs your support for Supporting DASHR's Community Response<a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/supporting-dashr039s-community-response">Denver Alliance for Street Health Response (DASHR) is an organization focused o… Vinnie Cervantes needs your support for Supporting DASHR's Community Response</a>]]></content:encoded>

Denver will go from sweltering heat with a high of 93 degrees on Monday to 34 degrees and snowing on Tuesday.

Not only is it environmentally wasteful and costly to taxpayers, but it condemns folks on the street to suffering and possibly death. Folks can’t take their tents and sleeping bags into shelters either, and surely in the middle of a global pandemic, we might understand why folks would rather be outside than crammed in shelters. </p><p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/">Denver Homeless Out Loud</a> is collecting sleeping bags, tents, tarps, and other survival gear at 2260 California until 5pm today and will distribute to folks in the area (contact info&#064;denverhomelessoutloud.org for questions). DASHR will be supporting folks in the Cap Hill area tomorrow by handing out hand warmers, socks, and supporting unhoused folks with our street medics. We will also be coordinating with the STAR van for crises that are beyond our street team.

We'd like to echo that call - let’s flood their registration process or let them know directly why trainings like this are dangerous and problematic and should be called off by emailing christie.mochoruk&#064;denvergov.org.</p><p> Why is this training a bad thing?</p>...<p> A department that has demonstrated again and again that it has no respect for the lives of our BIPOC neighbors, people experiencing homelessness, or protesters has no business teaching the community how to protect itself.</p><p> There is no way the racism baked into policing cannot replicate itself in how they teach neighbors to spy on each other (they can’t even keep it out of their logo - a menacing, featureless image of a "suspicious" black man).</p><p> The “intruder” mentality built by Neighborhood Watch programs, when combined with racial bias, results in vigilante murders like that of Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery.</p><p> Neighborhood Watch teaches communities to fear each other, to watch for “outsiders”, to surveil each other, and to rely on the threat of police violence to feel “safe”. True safety comes from communication, empathy, and mutual aid.

Is it being organized by Black, Indegeious, People of Color (BIPOC) organizations/individuals?  If this is not that case, are white organizers accountable to BIPOC organizations/individuals? How do they react when asked what their accountability process looks like?  Recognize that in times of crisis, BIPOC organizations are focused on doing what they can to support their communities AND many are grassroots organizations run largely by volunteers; they are not accountable to white people who often only show up during times of crisis. If they don&#x2019;t respond or don&#x2019;t respond right away if you reach out, respect that. Internally assess why you are protesting, and check in with yourself about where/whether you fit into any of the categories of white allies listed in &#x201c;Accomplices, Not Allies: Abolishing the Ally Industrial Complex&#x201d;.   If you believe that your liberation is tied to the liberation of BIPOC, show up. If it is for any other reason, stay home. Avoid centering yourself both emotionally and physically. Protests around racist police brutality, the carceral state, and state sanctioned murder are not about white people.  Do not tone police the response/actions of BIPOC organizers or protesters by condemning non peaceful approaches to protests. Hold other white protesters accountable and be accountable to BIPOC folks who are present.  Prioritize protests that are not permitted/do not coordinate with cops. Cops drastically reduce the safety of BIPOC protesters  Follow the directions and vision of BIPOC organizers.  If the action/protest is deemed &#x201c;non-confrontational&#x201d; by the organizers, avoid antagonizing counter protesters and cops.  Be prepared also to engage fellow white protesters who may not honor such guidelines. If confrontation does happen, be prepared to physically put your body between antagonizers and BIPOC in order to minimize the risk to BIPOC.  Follow the route determined by BIPOC organizers. If white folks want to take the protest in a direction that does not follow the vision of the organizers, avoid following suit." width="500" height="648" caption="image of flyer that says Accountability to Black, Indigenous, and People of Color Organizers/Protesters   Do research on who is organizing the action/protest.  Is it being organized by Black, Indegeious, People of Color (BIPOC) organizations/individuals?  If this is not that case, are white organizers accountable to BIPOC organizations/individuals? How do they react when asked what their accountability process looks like?  Recognize that in times of crisis, BIPOC organizations are focused on doing what they can to support their communities AND many are grassroots organizations run largely by volunteers; they are not accountable to white people who often only show up during times of crisis. If they don&#x2019;t respond or don&#x2019;t respond right away if you reach out, respect that. Internally assess why you are protesting, and check in with yourself about where/whether you fit into any of the categories of white allies listed in &#x201c;Accomplices, Not Allies: Abolishing the Ally Industrial Complex&#x201d;.   If you believe that your liberation is tied to the liberation of BIPOC, show up. If it is for any other reason, stay home. Avoid centering yourself both emotionally and physically. Protests around racist police brutality, the carceral state, and state sanctioned murder are not about white people.  Do not tone police the response/actions of BIPOC organizers or protesters by condemning non peaceful approaches to protests. Hold other white protesters accountable and be accountable to BIPOC folks who are present.  Prioritize protests that are not permitted/do not coordinate with cops. Cops drastically reduce the safety of BIPOC protesters  Follow the directions and vision of BIPOC organizers.  If the action/protest is deemed &#x201c;non-confrontational&#x201d; by the organizers, avoid antagonizing counter protesters and cops.  Be prepared also to engage fellow white protesters who may not honor such guidelines. If confrontation does happen, be prepared to physically put your body between antagonizers and BIPOC in order to minimize the risk to BIPOC.  Follow the route determined by BIPOC organizers. If white folks want to take the protest in a direction that does not follow the vision of the organizers, avoid following suit." /></a>]]></content:encoded>
