While this bill positions itself to fund programs like what we've been working on with multiple cities across Colorado and even across the country, the funding is restricted to law enforcement agencies and there is other language that would further harm our efforts. Taking Denver and Aurora for example, two cities we've worked with that have either launched or approved non-police models, neither city would theoretically be eligible for this funding for non-police models. Denver's STAR lives under Denver Department of Public Health and Environment and Aurora's program will live under a director position at the municipal level, outside of the police department. If these two programs are influencing this legislation, then the bill has fallen short of even supporting those cities, as well as others as there is tremendous nuance to each city we've worked to create programs with.</p><p> We ask our supporters and community to join us in opposing this bill as it has been written and invite folks to testify. You can do so virtually by signing up at <a href="https://www2.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2021A/commsumm.nsf/signIn.xsp">https://www2.leg.state.co.us/…/CLIC…/commsumm.nsf/signIn.xsp</a>. At the very least, we ask that folks submit written testimony or contact their elected officials with the following demands: </p><p> - Funding being open to entities that are not strictly law enforcement. If this bill is to support community partnerships, then funding must be open to the actual community partners.</p><p> - Equal or majority funding going towards non-police models versus co-responder models. There should be a distinction between the two as they are not the same and while there has been some positive impact from co-responder programs, we have heard from social workers that they are often inhibited from doing their jobs by the commanding presence of law enforcement.</p><p> - Remove the required $2 million set aside for law enforcement mental health as that would leave almost nothing for crisis response programs.</p><p> - Finally, if legislators are to work to support local programs that are community partnerships, then there should be more due diligence in engaging with the municipalities and community organizations doing the work before moving this bill forward in any form. </p><p> We believe that the state should help municipalities work to create non-police models that we've been working on, especially as cities have continued to note funding as a barrier. However, we reject the limited confines of this particular bill and insist on more engagement from those working to introduce it.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

We have waited long enough. The findings are in. Our elected officials can wait no longer to show the public that there is no greater public safety issue than removing those responsible for murdering Elijah to address the continued risk they pose to the community.</p><p> HOW: Using the top button on the “Justice for Elijah McClain” Linktree page, an email to the appropriate contacts will auto populate demanding justice for Elijah. (Please note all browsers populate differently and you may be required to edit for accuracy before sending.)</p><p> GOAL: DSURJ’s goal is to generate at least 25 new emails by the end of the week to send a clear message to Aurora officials that the community is watching. </p><p> Comment below and let us know you’ve reached out, and please share! </p><p> <a href="https://linktr.ee/Justiceforelijahmcclain">https://linktr.ee/Justiceforelijahmcclain</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SURJDenver/posts/2829165917357563">See More</a><a href="https://linktr.ee/Justiceforelijahmcclain">Linktree.
