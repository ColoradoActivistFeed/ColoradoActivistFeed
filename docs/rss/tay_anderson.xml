School Board Directors. </p><p> Today on the Brother Jeff Network some of the Fmr. SB Directors were on the show and when asked to provide evidence to support their claims they could not. When they called this board hostile, dysfunctional, discriminatory, etc. with no evidence and refused to talk with us before making public statements with false allegations they were aware of the negative ...implications that it would have in our communities.</p><p> Now I can not speak for the outgoing Superintendent, but when she announced this decision to our families she said she was NOT looking for a new job and that this had been a reoccurring ask from the Dallas ISD Superintendent. She has been very outspoken and honest and did not mention any push out from members of this School Board. So right now what is best for out students and teachers is that we get back to work for them.</p><p> I welcome anyone that has made a public statement condemning this board to also put resources, money, and personal time to helping us ensure that we can re-open our schools if COVID cases trend down over the remainder of 2020. I am always open to working together for our students, but I will not tolerate lies, undermining, or attempts to divide our communities to score political points.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Tay2019/posts/1256802218035949">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

Current DPS Superintendent Susanna Cordova resigned last week of her own accord. She announced that she was recruited and accepted a high-level position at a school district in the Dallas, Texas area. Furthermore, she will take a hefty pension from the DPS budget that will allow her to effectively “double-dip” and live quite comfortably. She departs as many school district leaders across Colorado and the nation jump ship during the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic as students languish without adequate access to the internet for remote learning from home as their parents struggle to make ends meet and the added challenge to secure childcare. </p><p> Mayor Hancock has decried Cordova’s resignation and has begun a coordinated and far-fetched effort to rebrand a simple resignation as “racism” and “sexism.”  This smacks of the familiar political opportunism that Mayor Hancock, and ERN/DFER cronies have heaped on all of Denver’s Latino community for far too long. The outgoing superintendent upheld her corporate interests and her family profited from her efforts in more ways than one. The “reform” crowd who is screaming “racism” is actually hurting the movement for racial, social and education justice. CLF reminds Denver that under the outgoing superintendent actually threatened striking teachers, most of them Latinas, with deportation. Furthermore, this same superintendent who hails from Denver, effectively drove her own alma mater at Lincoln High School into state intervention from the Colorado Department of Education after dividing the school into pieces for the benefit of corporate charter schools. These misappropriations, lies and racist actions by the Cordova-led administration cannot allow us to mischaracterize her lucrative departure as her being a victim to racism. </p><p> The sitting elected seven-member Board of Education members must engage in a search for a nationally-acclaimed superintendent of the highest caliber that supports —not a back-door, handpicked crony from a current meddling, opportunistic mayor. Denver deserves top-notch candidates who can steer the billion-dollar plus behemoth that is the independent government of DPS on a course that takes our students to their highest educational and social potential. Let’s stop calling racism when millionaires don’t get their way and support the Denver School Board’s search for an equity-driven, pro-public education candidate for this critical position.</p><p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/dps">#DPS</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/superintendent">#superintendent</a> <br /> Please see attached image for full statement.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

Olson</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Olson4DPS/posts/950799498785552"></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com"><i></i></a><p>Vice President Jennifer Bacon and I just recorded this statement regarding the impending superintendent search on behalf of all of the Board of Education of Den...ver Public Schools.  I'll post the recording here when I have it.  THANK YOU to all of you who are offering support and help during these challenging times.   During these times of crisis, we remember what Mr. Rogers says, “Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.”  We see you and we appreciate you. </p><p> “Thank you to everyone for your continued support and feedback as we navigate yet another difficult transition for Denver Public Schools. We are sending this statement to speak to Denverites who are made up of our students, our staff, our neighbors, and our community members.  We speak to you as duly elected members, selected by you, to represent your voice on the Denver Public Schools Board of Education.  We are former teachers in DPS, we are organizers, we are parents of DPS students, we are bilingual.  We are a recent alum, a reverend, a lawyer, a child of immigrants, and a former lieutenant governor.  We are honored to lead the students of DPS into a future where all students can receive the best public education to thrive and learn.  Students are always at the forefront of all we do.  </p><p> We are grateful for the many comments, suggestions and voices that have provided us with a lot of feedback and much to consider.  We welcome the chance to talk with everyone including fellow elected leaders, once we have a process in place. We also want and encourage the many voices in our community, who care so deeply about our schools, to help us during this process. We always receive feedback from the communities we represent with openness and reflection. Our goal has remained steadfast; ensuring we have the best schools for the students in our community.</p><p> We have been working through the timeline for transition, naming an interim, and a process for a superintendent search. We ask for your patience keeping in mind we are in the midst of a pandemic. We will share the process with the community before any decisions are made.  We will also announce an interim leader during the first week of December. </p><p> The Board has been clear that the Superintendent and her staff focus on the crisis priorities over the last 6 months in order to best serve our students and staff during this pandemic. In addition, the superintendent and the Board agreed to delay work on the next Denver Plan to best meet the urgent needs of our families in DPS. And, we know that this board believes in community voice as evidenced by the work we’ve taken on and how we’ve elevated students, teachers and principals voices.  In addition we’ve highlighted the voices of the communities who elected us.  We are committed to listening to all voices in our search, so that our students can have the public schools that they deserve..</p><p> All Board members were surprised and saddened by Susana Cordova’s departure.  We wish her the best of luck in her new job in Dallas. Any superintendent taking over when she did would have stepped into a difficult position.  When she started DPS was in transition as we came off of 10 years of one administration. That meant there were challenging situations to manage, with new points of view.  When we hired her, we recognized that she had the skills and passion to work with DPS. As we face leadership changes, one thing that stay the same is our commitment to prioritizing our students, </p><p> How we spend our time over the next days and months will be critical. Any time we spend discussing external claims takes us away from our priorities focused on placing an interim superintendent to guide us through this transition; and reopening our schools for our students and teachers.  </p><p> Like we always say to our students, be kind to each other. We are community and we will need each other. We call on everyone to model for our students how we can work together to build a strong public education system that we can all be proud of. We too always welcome constructive help and feedback. We particularly welcome help from any city leader, former school board member, and any concerned community leader to reopen our schools for a safe return in January.  </p><p> Again, we look forward to finding the next great leader of DPS. We will continue to work towards our vision of grassroots decision making, and elevating the voices of our most precious stakeholders.  We commit to seeing this moment as an opportunity to reflect on the past but not repeat it, and embrace the possibilities for all of our students.  We will be providing updates to the community as we work to find a new leader for DPS."</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

Hancock</p><p> We two mayors have worked hard for many years, together with t...housands of our fellow residents, to create a “Great City.” Prior to COVID-19, our economy was strong and diverse, unemployment was low, new companies and skilled workers moved here, neighborhoods and their local retailers were improving, more sports and cultural opportunities were available, and people were proud of our progress. To be sure, troubling challenges remain: the impacts of climate change; traffic congestion; homelessness and mental health needs; among<br /> others.</p><p> What’s clear is that the road to our collective vision of a great city begins with great schools. We have been involved in education for decades and are deeply concerned about the current Board of Education’s undermining of Superintendent Susana Cordova, which caused her to take her many talents to Dallas, Texas.</p><p> Notwithstanding a mixed record of performance over two decades, we have witnessed an improved DPS. DPS was a school district which was losing students, facing financial ruin and rated one of the worst school districts<br /> on achievement in Colorado twenty years ago. But over the past two decades, DPS has steadily made improvements. In the early 2000’s, only one third of all 4th graders were reading at grade level. Today, 44% are proficient as measured by higher academic standards under CMAS. Back then, less than half of Latino and Black students graduated from high school. Today, 68% of these students are graduating, 46% of Latino students are enrolling in higher education (a record number), and over 50% of all students are also progressing to higher<br /> education, also a record number. Student enrollment has increased over the years. DPS today has a growing number of Colorado’s highest performing high schools for low-income and students of color. The district had none in 2003. No other Colorado school district has made such progress across every measure: test scores, high school graduation and college attendance.</p><p> Tragically, this steady progress is now jeopardized as we lose Superintendent Susana Cordova, the first Latina school superintendent in Denver. Born and raised in Denver, Dr. Cordova attended DPS, and was a firstgeneration college graduate. Her life-long commitment to education progressed as a bilingual teacher, principal, administrator, Deputy Superintendent and then Superintendent over her thirty-one-year career. Her children attend DPS. She is recognized nationally as an outstanding education leader. She was arguably the most qualified and community focused Superintendent in decades. She prioritized student equity and success for all students. Rather than galvanizing behind this extraordinary talent once she was unanimously selected after a broad, national search, she was confronted with a teacher strike her first week as Superintendent. We found it troubling that past Anglo, male superintendents were never “struck.” </p><p> New school board members, some seeking to fire Dr. Cordova, were recruited and have opposed her efforts at almost at every opportunity. They mistreated her in public board meetings and interfered in the day-to-day management of the school system, rather than collaboratively establishing policies and direction for the district. They still have not developed a new district plan or long-term strategy beyond the expiring 2020 Plan. We cannot remain silent over this mistreatment of a hard-working and committed Superintendent. We care too<br /> deeply for the future of our students and our city, and we urge other residents to also become informed about the precarious condition of DPS. Sadly, some celebrate the loss of Dr. Cordova, while Dallas is cheering her arrival.</p><p> It is tragic to watch political fights among adult school board members with personal agendas and little focus on student success. The credibility of the Denver Board of Education was further undermined when the Colorado <br /> State Board of Education recently reversed the decision of the Denver board denying DSST-Noel from extending its current 8th Grade to a Noel High School. The current middle school, which is composed of 94% students of color, was the top performing school in Denver. The State Board’s stern reversal implies that the Denver Board’s decision was more politically, rather than educationally, based. Now we will be subjected to another costly, national search for a new superintendent which will likely become a “politized process.” We do not believe that this dysfunctional board can now attract a more capable superintendent than Susana Cordova, the leader who has worked her entire adult career for the students of Denver and for our city. The job is going to be even more challenging since we know that both Jefferson County and Douglas County are also looking for superintendents. Competing for talented leadership when the Denver Public Schools Board has yet to finalize a post-2020 plan is deeply concerning.</p><p> Therefore, we urge the Denver Board of Education to take the following steps to begin to regain some semblance of credibility among the broader community:</p><p> • First, an independent committee of residents should take the lead in recruiting, screening and recommending potential superintendent candidates to the school board. Working with a superior search firm, these residents should be objective and experienced in screening candidates and must not have a personal or political bias.</p><p> • Second, the board must immediately develop a new strategic plan (beyond Denver 2020) which describes the vision for DPS. Any prospective candidate Superintendent will want to know where DPS is headed other than the personal opinions of board members.</p><p> • Third, the board must take action to restore the confidence of the broader community, especially the Latino, African American and other communities of color, and reassure Denver residents that they will act responsibly and only in the best interests of students. It’s time to put aside personal political agendas<br /> and work collaboratively as a board should.</p><p> This is a critical time for the Denver Public Schools District. We must all act to ensure the overall progress of Denver.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>
