Black men is unacceptable. Property can be replaced, Black Lives cannot," she maintains.</p><p> ...</p><p> “The arrests are violent, resulting in broken bones and other serious injuries. The criminal charges are being inflated to increasingly serious offenses. Protesters are being forced to risk their safety and freedom in order to exercise their right to free speech," said Jessica Jones — a local criminal defense attorney and volunteer organizer for the Colorado NLG. "It is a sad paradox that protesters experience police violence as they protest police violence."</p><p> In addition to violent policing tactics in the name of crowd-control, Denver Police recently began invoking a little-used ordinance that was originally passed in anticipation of the 2008 Democratic National Convention protests. The law bans activists from carrying protective equipment, chains, and bike locks.</p><p> "This ordinance has allowed police to criminalize activists before a protest has even started," said Jones.</p><p> <a href="https://www.westword.com/news/denver-protest-arrests-likened-to-minority-report-11797388">https://www.westword.com/…/denver-protest-arrests-likened-t…</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php">See More</a><a href="https://www.westword.com/news/denver-protest-arrests-likened-to-minority-report-11797388">Possession of a helmet can allegedly lead to an arrest.<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDOHMSP4BLR8TPy&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages1.westword.com%2Fimager%2Fu%2Foriginal%2F11798121%2Fprotest_may30_eps_02.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQAD8Tds3vkIjeOM" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>westword.com</p><p>Claim: Denver Police Busting Protesters for Protecting Themselves</p>Possession of a helmet can allegedly lead to an arrest.<a href="https://www.westword.com/news/denver-protest-arrests-likened-to-minority-report-11797388">Possession of a helmet can allegedly lead to an arrest.</a>]]></content:encoded>

Stand in solidarity Thursday, 9/24, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/caapv">#CAAPV</a>! </p><p> “In case it interests, THURSDAY 9/24/20 from 8am to 2pm, there will be a protest at the 10th Circuit in Denver in opposition to the court's August decision in Millard erroneously finding Colorado's sex offender registry is not punishment. For more details contact WAR at the email address below. All are welcome, masks are encouraged:<br /> On Thursday, September 24, 2020, Women Against Registry and others dedicated to ...change in America’s sexual offense registration laws will be in front of the 10th Circuit Appeals Court building from 8 AM to 2 PM to protest the 10th Circuit’s ruling. The message is simple – the registry IS punishment. As we know it has altered the lives of human beings who merely want to have their lives fully restored.</p><p> We invite each and every person experiencing the punitiveness and stigma of registration to join us. Each man, woman or child can make a difference. Begin right now making plans to be part of the demonstration and/or donating to the initiative to help with travel, lodging, materials and brochures which are being designed as we speak. It will be a great time to meet others from like-minded organizations and be a part of something BIG!<br /> Let us know if you will be joining us so that we can keep you apprised of on-going plans and developments.</p><p> For more information, contact... 10thcirteam&#064;warfamilyfoundation.org”</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>
