It has put a great deal of us at-risk adult in harms way. For me, this can be a potential death sentence. At my age and with underlying health conditions, this feels like cruel and unusual punishment.”</p><p> — Anthony Martinez...</p><p> Anthony Martinez is an 84-year-old grandfather suffering from renal failure, as well as other serious medical conditions including dementia. He is currently incarcerated in the Sterling Correctional Facility, site of one of Colorado’s largest COVID-19 outbreaks with almost 600 active COVID-19 cases. He and his family are understandably terrified that he will catch the virus and die.</p><p> Anthony has spent over 30 years behind bars for a series of robberies. He has paid a substantial debt to society for these crimes. With his age and infirmity, no one can argue he is a public safety risk, but he has a substantial risk of becoming seriously ill or dying from COVID-19 if he remains incarcerated. Despite this, his special needs parole application was denied.</p><p> Anthony’s niece, Kelly, has a room in her home waiting for him to spend his final years. She says, “Only nine people on the side of the prison where my uncle is currently held are still negative for COVID-19. It’s all around him and it’s only a matter of time before he gets sick. I know my uncle is lonely and isolated. He uses a wheelchair, is hard of hearing and is locked in his cell almost all day. Prison is no place for elderly people. Please, I need my uncle home before he dies.”</p><p> In the midst of this public health crisis, incarcerated people as vulnerable as Anthony, could and should be immediately released to safely live out their remaining years with family.   <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/decarcerationday">#decarcerationday</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/freethemall">#FreeThemAll</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/covidjustice">#covidjustice</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/carenotcages">#carenotcages</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/endmassincarceration">#endmassincarceration</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/covidcolorado">#COVIDcolorado</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/doyourpart">#doyourpart</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/bringourneighborshome">#bringourneighborshome</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/redemptionisreal">#redemptionisreal</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/clemencyiscompassion">#clemencyiscompassion</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/106087521153591/photos/a.107461271016216/146190013810008/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/118510541_146190017143341_7052916449486077761_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=UvpFwADziCAAX-7Gzvf&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&oh=5afc36c16ae1609e842ec60c3046ba30&oe=5F77EF38" alt="Image may contain: 4 people, people standing and hat, text that says 'ACLU co NO ONE DESERVES &#x3c4;&#x3bf; DIE FROM COVID-19 MARTINEZ ANTHONY ANTHONY'S FAMILY IS READY &#x3a4;&#x3bf; WELCOME HIM HOME.'" width="500" height="500" caption="Image may contain: 4 people, people standing and hat, text that says 'ACLU co NO ONE DESERVES &#x3c4;&#x3bf; DIE FROM COVID-19 MARTINEZ ANTHONY ANTHONY'S FAMILY IS READY &#x3a4;&#x3bf; WELCOME HIM HOME.'" /></a>]]></content:encoded>

Surely he is aware that our carceral system is founded on racist principles, and the racial make-up of our prison...s is a reflection of historical and ongoing systemic racism.</p><p> Yet, rather than acknowledging the humanity of people living behind bars and the racism underlying the prison system, Gov. Polis has contributed to a public narrative that demonizes incarcerated people as unredeemable and too dangerous to be free. When advocates called for thoughtful releases of vulnerable incarcerated people, Gov. Polis’ response: He would not “let dangerous criminals out.”</p><p> Come on, governor. No one wants you to release “dangerous criminals.” We all want to be safe. That’s why advocates have been calling for the release of people who are elderly, sick, or have otherwise proven they are not a public safety threat. Decades of mass incarceration has ensured that there are many such people in Colorado’s prisons, and racism has ensured that those people will be disproportionately Black."</p><p> <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/08/21/colorado-prison-inmates-covid-polis-opinion/">https://www.denverpost.com/…/colorado-prison-inmates-covid…/</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php">See More</a><a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/08/21/colorado-prison-inmates-covid-polis-opinion/">Black people living behind bars face a racist double whammy – because of their blackness they are more likely to be imprisoned, more likely to get COVID, and more likely to die from the virus.<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDU2ss0M9u-Cnys&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.denverpost.com%2Fwp-content%2Fthemes%2Fdenverpost%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fdenverpost.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQAY47PODuk1InCF" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>denverpost.com</p><p>Guest commentary: If Black lives matter to him, Polis needs to reduce prison population</p>Black people living behind bars face a racist double whammy – because of their blackness they are more likely to be imprisoned, more likely to get COVID, and more likely to die from the virus.<a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/08/21/colorado-prison-inmates-covid-polis-opinion/">Black people living behind bars face a racist double whammy – because of their blackness they are more likely to be imprisoned, more likely to get COVID, and more likely to die from the virus.</a>]]></content:encoded>

Mark your 🗓! 🔊🔊</p><p> More details to come, but on AUGUST 27 at NOON, we will stand on the Capitol steps in solidarity with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/acluofcolorado/">ACLU of Colorado</a>’s Day of Action and raise our voices to tell Governor Polis to act before more bodies are sacrificed in cages while COVID-19 rages on with no end in sight. </p><p> Come stand on the steps with us to tell Governor Polis that a jail and prison sentence shouldn’t be a death sentence - something he confirmed with his own pen. Stand with us as we stand for the people who are being forced to live in death chambers across our state. Now is not the time to be silent or complacent. Wear a 😷, bring your friends, and share this post to 🔊 get the word out!</p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/106087521153591/photos/a.107461271016216/143840964044913/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s640x640/118239802_143840967378246_2850325126510942752_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=Cj_v61cv2IkAX8JurBz&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=7&oh=1aa1f90da0c0d349b3da3b18d4543a52&oe=5F78D818" alt="Image may contain: text that says '#CAAPV Stands In Solidarity And Urges You To Join Us On DECARCERATION DAY What: An Action To Tell Govenor Polis That Incarceration Should Not Death Sentence And That He Must Address COVID-19 Raging Through Colorado Jails And Prisons When: August 27, Noon Where: Capitol Steps CAAPV FB Colorado Attorneys Against Police Violence ContactCAAPV gmail.com'" width="500" height="639" caption="Image may contain: text that says '#CAAPV Stands In Solidarity And Urges You To Join Us On DECARCERATION DAY What: An Action To Tell Govenor Polis That Incarceration Should Not Death Sentence And That He Must Address COVID-19 Raging Through Colorado Jails And Prisons When: August 27, Noon Where: Capitol Steps CAAPV FB Colorado Attorneys Against Police Violence ContactCAAPV gmail.com'" /></a>]]></content:encoded>
