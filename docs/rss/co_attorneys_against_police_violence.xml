When we are transforming an inherently racist and persistently violent institution, no option should be off the table—including changes in leadership and immediately redirecting a portion of the DPD budget to repairing the harm and rebuilding the public’s trust. </p><p> Find ways to take action here: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CandiCdeBacaD9/posts/700951807291994">https://www.facebook.com/CandiCdeBaca…/posts/700951807291994</a></p><p> “The watchdog could not paint a full picture of violence because the police department was not fully transparent.</p><p> "According to the report, body cameras often remained off. Officers often failed to file use-of-force reports. Many also failed to identify themselves by name or badge number. DPD said it did not document who worked the first four days of the protests. And the OIM found that the department did not effectively track its use of munitions, which would’ve helped officials understand the level of violence....</p><p> "Meanwhile, 18 other jurisdictions aided DPD’s response, and some used weapons and tactics that are not approved by DPD.</p><p> "After police ran out of munitions on the first night, they received a literal plane-load of new ones. But DPD brass doesn’t know exactly who used them and how they were used.”</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php">See More</a><a href="https://denverite.com/2020/12/08/police-officers-acted-dangerously-and-anonymously-during-protests-against-police-brutality-and-racism-investigation-finds/">Unwarranted and reckless violence, a lack of body camera footage and missing or vague documentation amounted to a mismanaged response from the very institution being protested.
