Black men is unacceptable. Property can be replaced, Black Lives cannot," she maintains.</p><p> ...</p><p> “The arrests are violent, resulting in broken bones and other serious injuries. The criminal charges are being inflated to increasingly serious offenses. Protesters are being forced to risk their safety and freedom in order to exercise their right to free speech," said Jessica Jones — a local criminal defense attorney and volunteer organizer for the Colorado NLG. "It is a sad paradox that protesters experience police violence as they protest police violence."</p><p> In addition to violent policing tactics in the name of crowd-control, Denver Police recently began invoking a little-used ordinance that was originally passed in anticipation of the 2008 Democratic National Convention protests. The law bans activists from carrying protective equipment, chains, and bike locks.</p><p> "This ordinance has allowed police to criminalize activists before a protest has even started," said Jones.</p><p> <a href="https://www.westword.com/news/denver-protest-arrests-likened-to-minority-report-11797388">https://www.westword.com/…/denver-protest-arrests-likened-t…</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php">See More</a><a href="https://www.westword.com/news/denver-protest-arrests-likened-to-minority-report-11797388">Possession of a helmet can allegedly lead to an arrest.<img src="https://external.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDOHMSP4BLR8TPy&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages1.westword.com%2Fimager%2Fu%2Foriginal%2F11798121%2Fprotest_may30_eps_02.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQAD8Tds3vkIjeOM" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>westword.com</p><p>Claim: Denver Police Busting Protesters for Protecting Themselves</p>Possession of a helmet can allegedly lead to an arrest.<a href="https://www.westword.com/news/denver-protest-arrests-likened-to-minority-report-11797388">Possession of a helmet can allegedly lead to an arrest.</a>]]></content:encoded>
