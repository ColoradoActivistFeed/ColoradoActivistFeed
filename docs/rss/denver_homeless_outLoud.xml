Tell the Ma...yor to stop the violence and provide safe and stable housing and outdoor camping space for our relatives!! Click here to TAKE ACTION today: <a href="https://bit.ly/SafeOutdoorSpace">bit.ly/SafeOutdoorSpace</a> </p><p> Here's some background: </p><p> A community of unhoused Native people have set up camp outside of the Four Winds building at 5th & Bannock. The City reached out and Four Winds organized a meeting between the City and our relatives last Tuesday. </p><p> Despite the City's promises that the camp would be protected in the near future from a sweep and that they would share the camp's demands for a Native Safe Outdoor Space and better housing solutions with city leaders, we have now learned that the camp is due to be posted this week and swept next week. The City has not taken action on the proposed solutions the camp provided, and has offered no solutions of their own for our relatives camped here, they just want them gone. </p><p> Just this past Friday, DPD went to the camp and only gave citations to Native people who were camping, and arrested one of our brothers during morning ceremony. In the process of arresting him, they damaged, disrespected, and confiscated his eagle feathers and destroyed his camp and others' camps. </p><p> For those of you who have been tracking the ongoing violence against unhoused people in Denver, this is nothing new. The City doesn't have a solution, and clearly the only thing they have the will to do is criminalize and abuse people who have nowhere else to go. </p><p> We need our community and our partners to take action now, and make it clear to the Mayor and the City that this can't continue--they need to put time and resources into actually addressing this issue, especially for the Native community since our people are the most overrepresented group in Denver's homeless population.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

There were no residents present to claim belongings. One person's stuff was stored while the others were trashed. There was no one to ask or to give the claim ticket to. <br /> SWEEPS continued on Wednesday 8/18 at W Bayaud and S Raritan St. There as one housed resident who had legally parked their RV along the line of RVs set for traumatic displacement and was grouped in with everyone ...else (they clearly had not been given notice nor were they violating any law). Their RV was illegally entered and searched. The resident was removed from the area and prohibited from returning. Approximately 30 people were traumatically displaced.</p><p> No SWEEPS were scheduled on Thursday however one injunction violation was caught and stopped. It was a posting that did not meet the injunction requirements at 9th and Grant. Despite having an email from City Attorney Wendy O'Shea correcting the mistake,  private security at the location  attempted to carry out a forced removal. The City failed to communicate to them their mistake.</p><p> On Friday, another injunction violation was attempted. DPD, DOTI, and EHS descended on a camp located at 5th and Bannock. This camp was not posted and DHOL received an email from Chris Conner, Director of Homelessness Resolution that " Most recently, 5/Bannock was moved from the posting schedule..." When volunteers arrived to document, DOTI, EHS, and DPD left. </p><p> The encampment at 5th and Bannock is predominantly indigenous, living in a culturally appropriate way on their own land. America's legacy of genocide and forced removal continues, today, in Denver. <br /> SWEEPING people does not work. Homeleesness is solved by HOUSING. Until we have the housing for people to move into, we must stop this nonsensical and expensive whack-a-mole non solution. We march onward towards Rights, Dignity, Housing....</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/2287112278085379">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/photos/pcb.2287112278085379/2287111624752111/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/p526x296/239243937_2287111631418777_9000483733972621423_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=ZPpmzqEytaUAX-gASk6&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&oh=5019e3500ecf42b3b55fa8c800c1b547&oe=614AB615" alt="May be an image of tree and road" width="500" height="375" caption="May be an image of tree and road" />{"\u0040context":"https:\/\/schema.org","\u0040type":"SocialMediaPosting","dateCreated":"2021-08-20T11:42:34-0700","dateModified":"2021-08-20T11:42:34-0700","identifier":"2287111624752111:9:0","headline":"Denver Homeless Out Loud added... - Denver Homeless Out Loud","interactionStatistic":[{"\u0040type":"InteractionCounter","interactionType":"https:\/\/schema.org\/CommentAction","userInteractionCount":0},{"\u0040type":"InteractionCounter","interactionType":"http:\/\/schema.org\/LikeAction","userInteractionCount":0},{"\u0040type":"InteractionCounter","interactionType":"http:\/\/schema.org\/ShareAction","userInteractionCount":0},{"\u0040type":"InteractionCounter","interactionType":"http:\/\/schema.org\/FollowAction","userInteractionCount":14824}],"commentCount":0,"author":{"\u0040type":"Organization","name":"Denver Homeless Out Loud","identifier":217504118379549,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/DenverHomelessOutLoud\/","image":"https:\/\/scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.18169-1\/12645267_765701936893095_4336088808811260721_n.png?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=a12de3&_nc_ohc=tIKAy56YGdQAX-bBvUz&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&oh=93f3e1dfc1b2037d279b6824528845d4&oe=614C355C","sameAs":"http:\/\/denverhomelessoutloud.org\/","foundingDate":"2012-10-13T22:03:50-0700"},"image":[{"\u0040type":"ImageObject","width":787,"contentUrl":"https:\/\/scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.6435-9\/239243937_2287111631418777_9000483733972621423_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=ZPpmzqEytaUAX-gASk6&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&oh=05c4c8c2edf676b5abd262f816efc04e&oe=6149E535","caption":""}]}</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/photos/pcb.2287112278085379/2287112194752054/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/p526x296/239648833_2287112198085387_3783713197805009895_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=VwX79x7rMz4AX_AObSX&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&oh=e268f0ec041324a11379050e818261d8&oe=6149B92E" alt="May be an image of road" width="500" height="353" caption="May be an image of road" />{"\u0040context":"https:\/\/schema.org","\u0040type":"SocialMediaPosting","dateCreated":"2021-08-20T11:42:34-0700","dateModified":"2021-08-20T11:42:34-0700","identifier":"2287112194752054:9:0","headline":"Denver Homeless Out Loud added... - Denver Homeless Out Loud","interactionStatistic":[{"\u0040type":"InteractionCounter","interactionType":"https:\/\/schema.org\/CommentAction","userInteractionCount":0},{"\u0040type":"InteractionCounter","interactionType":"http:\/\/schema.org\/LikeAction","userInteractionCount":0},{"\u0040type":"InteractionCounter","interactionType":"http:\/\/schema.org\/ShareAction","userInteractionCount":0},{"\u0040type":"InteractionCounter","interactionType":"http:\/\/schema.org\/FollowAction","userInteractionCount":14824}],"commentCount":0,"author":{"\u0040type":"Organization","name":"Denver Homeless Out Loud","identifier":217504118379549,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/DenverHomelessOutLoud\/","image":"https:\/\/scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.18169-1\/12645267_765701936893095_4336088808811260721_n.png?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=a12de3&_nc_ohc=tIKAy56YGdQAX-bBvUz&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&oh=93f3e1dfc1b2037d279b6824528845d4&oe=614C355C","sameAs":"http:\/\/denverhomelessoutloud.org\/","foundingDate":"2012-10-13T22:03:50-0700"},"image":[{"\u0040type":"ImageObject","width":836,"contentUrl":"https:\/\/scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.6435-9\/239648833_2287112198085387_3783713197805009895_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=VwX79x7rMz4AX_AObSX&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&oh=97afe32c71d4d74e10f9b6f32199cc17&oe=614A970E","caption":""}]}</a>]]></content:encoded>

DPD enetred her legally parked RV without a warrant and conducted an illegal search and seizure on a housed resident, taxpayer, fully compliant with the law. Great job DPD. All Denver residents should be alarmed. This could happen to you.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This was a fully industrial area, no residential. Most folks had left before the fencing showed up. There were approximately 10 people traumatically displaced.<br /> SWEEPS on Wednesday 8/11 at Park Avenue West, Tremont Place, West 20th Avenue and Welton Street. Housed neighbors were allowed inside the fencing with a uhaul full of horse troughs that they dumped where folks had been ...swept from. We were told that Storybright (who is set to open luxury apartments on Glenarm between 21st and 22nd) had received permitting to do so. There were approximately 50 people traumatically displaced.<br /> SWEEPS this week concluded on Thursday 8/12 at 34th Street, Arapahoe Street, 32nd Street and Walnut Street. A resident of the camp had his ID, medication, and other personal belongings trashed while he was getting breakfast at the mutual aid table. Approximately 25 were traumatically displaced.</p><p> SWEEPS don't solve homelessness! Homelessness ends with housing.

(aka storybook builders) has convinced the neighbors to install these ugly horse troughs in the FB live feed below.  PSW's plan is to plan to build the condos below.  But first they desire to push homeless out of the area and then they put in anti homeless infrastructure. In this case ugly horses troughs and trying to pass them off as "planters" / gardens.  </p><p> Apparently they have enough influence over the city to be allowed in the f...enced off sweep while others are kept out.  How much do you think that privaledge cost them?  And how do you think they paid for that privaledge?  Directly to the Mayors campaign?  To some real-estate PAC who then contributed to the Mayors campaign.  This is what corruption looks like.

This presentation will be both in person at the City and County Building in the Council Chambers, and virtually at <a href="https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_SrJLqP3TTRqWZrnyFczQ1A">https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_SrJLqP3TTRqWZrnyFczQ1A</a>. </p><p> All are welcome to attend!</p>...<p> This report shows how sweeps have been completely ineffective in connecting unhoused people with housing or addressing the health and sanitation needs they are supposed to address. The experiences of the 150 unhoused people who answered this survey make it very clear that what the city is doing is insane and causing great harm. The report also gives 16 recommendations. This is the City Councilâ€™s chance to take action to implement these recommendations.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/2279971042132836">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/photos/a.271630356300258/2279970945466179/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/p526x296/235973627_2279970952132845_3633673408064536656_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=qXjsGciD49MAX93G8jK&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&oh=671612178dc695a8cd8565cbd94c72bc&oe=6149824A" alt="May be an image of text that says 'Belongings taken during sweeps All, everything. most Sleeping bag. sleeping Personal Other belongings, vandus.em Electronics, Birth certificate, Papers, lot Family heirlooms jewelry Learned move forced Storage Pictures Everyday Don't tents items DOTI Grill 05101520253035'" width="500" height="282" caption="May be an image of text that says 'Belongings taken during sweeps All, everything. most Sleeping bag. sleeping Personal Other belongings, vandus.em Electronics, Birth certificate, Papers, lot Family heirlooms jewelry Learned move forced Storage Pictures Everyday Don't tents items DOTI Grill 05101520253035'" /></a>]]></content:encoded>
