He will find out when the city stands before a federal judge on Dec 15th. he is not. </p>...<p> The Federal courts will be telling the city that they cannot lie about made up "health and safety" issues as an excuse to throw always peoples property and get a way with it. They will also tell them they cannot lie about what they agreed to in front of a federal judge. They also cannot lie and claim that they are acting in the spirit of the Lyall vs Denver lawsuit settlement. They were scolded before about not working in good faith by this same Judge. They will be standing before the same Judge who is likely to be none to pleased  with the cities behavior.  </p><p> <a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/denver-mayor-michael-hancock-travels-thanksgiving/73-e6b5f236-b0c7-4415-a22e-c84dd6f7acf1?fbclid=IwAR2b-vblBk1jhc-injhJ2mBywg9JOsnDMXWZ44q2CLZQKTegE9V4TOig-kY">https://www.9news.com/…/73-e6b5f236-b0c7-4415-a22e-c84dd6f7…</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/2063689463760996">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/photos/a.271630356300258/2063689310427678/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s526x296/128066233_2063689313761011_8162278371016558775_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=9gqacWUwSJ0AX8hRcP1&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=7&oh=590c7d918f088bacbed331a0a9c25b86&oe=5FE8A025" alt="Image may contain: 1 person, text that says '20 Hippo Crit'" width="500" height="288" caption="Image may contain: 1 person, text that says '20 Hippo Crit'" /></a>]]></content:encoded>

This suit demands that sweeps be halted, at least during the COVID pandemic, to protect the health and safety of the community with and without housi...ng - as in line with CDC guidance. The suit states, “The CDC issued this guidance because conducting sweeps significantly increases the risk to homeless individuals, and the community, of infection with COVID-19. Despite this clear warning, the defendants chose to act in direct contradiction of public health guidance and to violate the property and due process rights of homeless individuals in a cruel and dangerous manner.” </p><p> On top of this the suit addresses that, “Over the past year, and in a blatant effort to skirt a settlement agreement entered into between Denver and a class of its homeless population, Denver officials have repeatedly showed up at homeless encampments without notice, flatly told homeless residents to move along (“to where?” is the obvious question to this nonsensical command), and seized their property (often discarding it).” The City cannot get away with these violations of the lawsuit settlement agreement nor with the blatant disregard for the health of those who can’t afford housing during this pandemic. </p><p> Plaintiffs for this case lost all their property in sweeps, including a mass sweep of Lincoln Park conducted by the City and State together on July 29th, 2020 with no notice. One plaintiff, Charles explains how after gathering all he could in one trip to move from the park that morning, that “when I returned to the spot where my tent had been, I found that it had been taken and destroyed by Denver officials, along with everything in it.” Hundreds of people lost all their property in that one sweep. These same hundreds of people have been chased around the City in sweep after sweep since that time. </p><p> Due to COVID regulations people will not be able to attend the hearing in person. There will be a call-in number where the public can listen to the hearing. Stay tuned for this number. We will also be holding a rally and press conference prior to the hearings at 8am outside the Alfred J. Arraj United States Courthouse (901 19th St - 20th and Champa) with safe distancing measures in place.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/2062528237210452">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/photos/a.271630356300258/2062528193877123/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/127470190_2062528197210456_1957097220932393119_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=3Ca6Pm2rv98AX-KlrZ3&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=da52da10c38b2a27268be29c1826f840&oe=5FE76BAB" alt="Image may contain: text that says 'SWEEPS COVID-19 IFEVERYONE CAN'T C AFFORD THE BENT CAN KILL THEY SHOULDN'T E&#x39b;ACKING TAKE OUR TENT'" width="500" height="667" caption="Image may contain: text that says 'SWEEPS COVID-19 IFEVERYONE CAN'T C AFFORD THE BENT CAN KILL THEY SHOULDN'T E&#x39b;ACKING TAKE OUR TENT'" /></a>]]></content:encoded>

There are around 300 houseless people living at this site. Residents have lived at this site consistently for over 9 months. The site surrounds a vacant lot of land and is next to the Cross Roads Shelter and the River on the other sides. For the past coup...le months police have been telling people who they sweep from other more visible downtown sites to go to Arkins. Now the City plans to come in and sweep them. To where???</p><p>  </p><p> Why not provide dumpsters with regular trash pick up? Why not provide port-a-potties (at least 1 for every 10 people)? And if not that...why not provide housing that residents of this camp can afford according to their info? </p><p>  </p><p> No, instead our City thinks sweeping 300 people to scatter to downtown blocks, down the river, or who knows where else is the answer.</p><p>  </p><p> Please come and support our unhoused community members at 29th and Arkins on Monday November 30th. Or come down before to show this community some love and support by bringing food, trash bags, or get to know some of the residents. </p><p>  </p><p> Bring the following things to assist residents:</p><p> -Truck, or any vehicle to help </p><p> -Carts</p><p> -Bungee Cords</p><p> -Rope</p><p> -Trash Bags</p><p> -Food</p><p> -Coffee/CoCo</p><p> -Water</p><p> Your assistance is much appreciated.

(The f)irst, inherent in homelessness, is the racial inequity that must be addressed.”</p><p> This year’s Boulder Point In Time count showed Black people are 12 times more represented in the county’s unhoused population compared to the general population. For the region, indigenous people are seven times overrepresented. Combined with the fact that, per the MDHI report, “the leading cause of homelessness, not just in this region but around the country, is a lack of affordable housing,” we must stop repeat- ing fallacious claims that homelessness is the result of poor choices.</p><p> Throw in a pandemic and the situation is far worse, with a wide swath of Boulder’s residents facing an increased risk of eviction and homelessness and resulting health risks: risks that are also disproportionately greater for our Black and brown community members.</p><p> The HRC is right to sound the alarm about “possible human rights violations by the City.” We restrict access to basic shelter to people who haven’t lived here for six months, e.g., regardless of the vulnerability of such people. Multiple people are known to have already frozen to death since the first snow fell here, and the city’s policy is people experiencing homelessness are only allowed 30 days of severe weather shelter per season if, e.g., they have not lived here six months or are otherwise excluded from the precious few services that remain.</p><p> This exclusion of nonresidents flies in the face of the constitutional right to travel. Supreme Court Justice John Stevens ruled in 1999 that the Constitution provides “the right to enter one state and leave another, the right to be treated as a welcome visitor rather than a hostile stranger.” Justice William Brennan likewise held in 1974 that statutory prohibition of welfare benefits to residents of less than a year creates a classification that constitutes an invidious discrimination denying them equal protection of the laws. Sadly, enforcing such rights requires resources and access to the courts that are too often — just like shelter beds — unavailable to the poor and hurting.</p><p> Our Boulder community has recently shown that it is compassionate, donating greatly to food banks and to EFAA, and voting in favor of providing funding for legal assistance to those facing eviction with the successful No Eviction Without Representation ballot initiative.</p><p> Now that the Human Relations Commission has rung the bell regarding the City’s “propagat( ing) public relations messages misleading the public” about unhoused programs, that compassion remains as needed as ever.</p><p> Darren O’Connor is an attorney in Boulder, chairs the NAACP Boulder County Branch Criminal Justice Committee and is a regional vice president of the National Lawyers Guild.</p><p> Thomas John Hamilton, who is homeless, lies steps away from where boulder police cleared an illegal encampment along boulder Creek beneath the ninth Street bridge in February 2019.</p><p> Sam Lounsberry / File Photo"<br /> <a href="https://www.dailycamera.com/2020/11/21/guest-opinion-darren-oconnor-city-of-boulder-should-match-communitys-compassion-for-the-unhoused/">https://www.dailycamera.com/…/guest-opinion-darren-oconnor…/</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a><a href="https://www.dailycamera.com/2020/11/21/guest-opinion-darren-oconnor-city-of-boulder-should-match-communitys-compassion-for-the-unhoused/">The Human Relations Commission rang the bell regarding Boulder’s “public relations messages misleading the public” about homelessness programs,<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDfobfEmXCunhYk&w=476&h=249&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailycamera.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F09%2FDCC-L-HOMELESSCAMPSWEEP_TH28845.jpg%3Fw%3D1024%26h%3D683&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQAopKA7EIVxCy7G" alt="" width="474" height="248" caption="" /></a><p>dailycamera.com</p><p>Guest Opinion: Darren O’Connor: City of Boulder should match community’s compassion for the unhoused</p>The Human Relations Commission rang the bell regarding Boulder’s “public relations messages misleading the public” about homelessness programs,<a href="https://www.dailycamera.com/2020/11/21/guest-opinion-darren-oconnor-city-of-boulder-should-match-communitys-compassion-for-the-unhoused/">The Human Relations Commission rang the bell regarding Boulder’s “public relations messages misleading the public” about homelessness programs,</a>]]></content:encoded>
