The issue of our unhoused neighbors is all of our issue. In fact all movements are the same one, the right to exist freely. I think our (DHOL) lawsuit against the city and the ability for people to call in and listen really showed the cruel heartlessness of SWEEPS policy in Denver. All In Denver is composed of Hancock allies and critics from a range of professions, including consultants, developers and homeless service providers.  Thank You All In Denver for your support for our Denver residents.</p><p> <a href="https://images.westword.com/media/pdf/aid_homeless_sweeps_media_release_december_2020_final.pdf">https://images.westword.com/…/aid_homeless_sweeps_media_rel…</a></p><p>images.westword.com</p><p>images.westword.com</p><a href="https://images.westword.com/media/pdf/aid_homeless_sweeps_media_release_december_2020_final.pdf"></a>]]></content:encoded>

Our two final witnesses spoke: Michael Lamb testified regarding how he was displaced in multiple sweeps and lost property, forcing him to move farther and farther from resources and to live without any tent or protection. A Dr of psychiatry testified to how sweeps are a kind to natural disasters putting people... who are swept at greater risk of suicide, overdose, among other pycological harms. Then the City started their witnesses. Charlotte Pitt, manager of Solid Waste, testified that the City trashes entire tents and all the property inside them if they find any “hazzard”, such as a bottle of pee that someone uses to due to the lack of bathrooms, as opposed to simply trashing the bottle. Dannica Lee, director of inspections for DDPHE, admitted in her testimony that there are direct ways to address the public health concerns at encampments without sweeping. The directing Dr at Denver Health testified that outdoor environments are safer against COVID than indoor environments - which includes congregate shelters that the City presented as the option they are offering people from sweeps.    </p><p> Testimony will continue with the remaining City’s witnesses for one more day sometime in January. Stay tuned for the new date. </p><p> We do not know when Judge Martinez will issue the order regarding the case, but we are hoping it will be shortly after the final hearing.</p><p> Onward toward housing not sweeps...!</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/2082743095188966">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/photos/pcb.2082743095188966/2082742821855660/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p235x350/131916003_2082742825188993_2469643576374397829_o.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=0i-09CfQ2toAX-0lgAJ&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=cf922d4cdf1c303f37e786b9dc23932f&oe=600F2B27" alt="Image may contain: one or more people, people standing and outdoor" width="500" height="334" caption="Image may contain: one or more people, people standing and outdoor" /></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/photos/pcb.2082743095188966/2082743025188973/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/131919673_2082743028522306_7739234045547946168_o.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=FZlZXPoXd3UAX85Fv1r&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=f24337e6b6f38764a443ba4922cd21fe&oe=600F2F4E" alt="Image may contain: 5 people, night, hat, beard, closeup and outdoor" width="500" height="376" caption="Image may contain: 5 people, night, hat, beard, closeup and outdoor" /></a>]]></content:encoded>

Witnesses spoke all day concerning the severe health risk of sweeping encampments during covid, the City’s regular practice of trashing people’s property regardless of their settlement agreement not to do so, and the alternative measures the city could be taking to provide real housing and sanitation needs for ...encampment residents. Steve, a housless man, testified how he lost all his property in a sweep while he was gone looking for work and came back to all his worldly belongings being trashed by the city. His testimony is representative of the experience of hundreds of housless people in Denver. </p><p> Testimony will continue tomorrow (December 16th) all day, starting with two more witnesses for the housless community and followed by all of the City’s witnesses. You can call in to listen at 877-336-1828 access code 9449909#. We will also gather tomorrow (December 16th) again for breakfast at 19th and Champa in front of the court house for any who want to come. </p><p> We do not know when Judge Martinez will issue the order regarding the case, but it will likely be a week or so after tomorrow.

Dec 15th </p><p> ★ Come to the Press Conference before the Hearing on Tuesday! Social Distanced Press Conference and Breakfast Tuesday December 15th at 8am before the hearing at 20th and Champa. </p><p> ...<br /> We have an access number you can call to listen to the hearing December 15th and 16th starting 9am going all day. </p><p> For public audio access to the hearing, please call 877-336-1828 and enter access code 9449909#.</p><p> On December 15th and 16th, 2020, Federal District 10 Judge Martinez will be hearing our case against the City of Denver and the State of Colorado for violating constitutional rights by sweeping people without homes and with nowhere to go - even in a global pandemic. This suit demands that sweeps be halted, at least during the COVID pandemic, to protect the health and safety of the community with and without housing - as in line with CDC guidance. The suit states, “The CDC issued this guidance because conducting sweeps significantly increases the risk to homeless individuals, and the community, of infection with COVID-19. Despite this clear warning, the defendants chose to act in direct contradiction of public health guidance and to violate the property and due process rights of homeless individuals in a cruel and dangerous manner.” </p><p>  <br /> On top of this the suit addresses that, “Over the past year, and in a blatant effort to skirt a settlement agreement entered into between Denver and a class of its homeless population, Denver officials have repeatedly showed up at homeless encampments without notice, flatly told homeless residents to move along (“to where?” is the obvious question to this nonsensical command), and seized their property (often discarding it).” The City cannot get away with these violations of the lawsuit settlement agreement nor with the blatant disregard for the health of those who can’t afford housing during this pandemic. </p><p>  <br /> Plaintiffs for this case lost all their property in sweeps, including a mass sweep of Lincoln Park conducted by the City and State together on July 29th, 2020 with no notice. One plaintiff, Charles explains how after gathering all he could in one trip to move from the park that morning, that “when I returned to the spot where my tent had been, I found that it had been taken and destroyed by Denver officials, along with everything in it.” Hundreds of people lost all their property in that one sweep. These same hundreds of people have been chased around the City in sweep after sweep since that time. </p><p> Due to COVID regulations people will not be able to attend the hearing in person. You can call 877-336-1828 and enter access code 9449909# to listen to the hearing. We will also be holding a rally and press conference prior to Tuesday’s hearings at 8am outside the Alfred J. Arraj United States Courthouse (901 19th St - 20th and Champa) with safe distancing measures in place.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/2080262088770400">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/photos/a.271630356300258/2080261962103746/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/131426642_2080261965437079_5359694594643764931_o.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=FK3AFDi1pa8AX-9bI5b&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=1324679dc5227daa7b25280206a375a0&oe=600E734C" alt="No photo description available." width="500" height="773" caption="No photo description available." /></a>]]></content:encoded>

"<br /> --------<br /> A lot of people try to do things that are unlikely. For example there are many who try to qualify for the Olympics, but only few do because the completion is so great. When they do we celebrate them.  </p><p> The challenge of qualifying for housing is similar. There is not enough housin...g for all those who need it.  So the competition to get into the available housing is great and few actually make it in.  Yet a statement like the one above makes it seem as if it is a processing issue and not an availability issue.  </p><p> The shelters are full.   <br /> The shelters are dangerous especially during Covid. </p><p> If housing was available people would be getting housed.   The lack of housing is why people are on the streets in the first place. <br /> So media typically discuss every thing except the most needed thing ACTUAL UNITS OF HOSUSING that people can live in insted of the street.   It will mean things like construction of budget housing (vs what realestale lobbyiests "market rate" aka "luxury"). </p><p> It will mean things like the construction of public housing.  <br /> (public housing is gov't subsidised housing. </p><p> BTW Budget housing is not gov't subsidised, and is availble on the market , one of our poblems in thehousing market is that no one builds budget housing and it is our reatest need.   </p><p> Rent control etc.  </p><p> All that is discussed what the service providers are doing because they are the ones that get the money instead of building or buying the units we need.</p><p> <a href="https://denverite.com/2020/11/28/denver-tries-a-new-approach-at-large-encampments-to-help-people-experiencing-homelessness/">https://denverite.com/…/denver-tries-a-new-approach-at-lar…/</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/2077709022359040">See More</a><a href="https://denverite.com/2020/11/28/denver-tries-a-new-approach-at-large-encampments-to-help-people-experiencing-homelessness/">As large encampments multiply in Denver, city workers conduct cleanup after cleanup that shift tent cities from one block to another, hardly a solution for either the people living on the streets o…<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQEVstNB3qCGPcmo&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fi0.wp.com%2Fwp-denverite.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F4%2F2020%2F11%2F201117-HOMELESSNESS-SWEEP-FIVE-POINTS-HOUSING-KEVINJBEATY-01.jpg%3Fresize%3D1200%252C630%26ssl%3D1&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQH1HfZfZAbMhGx7" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>denverite.com</p><p>Denver tries a new approach at large encampments to help people experiencing homelessness</p>As large encampments multiply in Denver, city workers conduct cleanup after cleanup that shift tent cities from one block to another, hardly a solution for either the people living on the streets o…<a href="https://denverite.com/2020/11/28/denver-tries-a-new-approach-at-large-encampments-to-help-people-experiencing-homelessness/">As large encampments multiply in Denver, city workers conduct cleanup after cleanup that shift tent cities from one block to another, hardly a solution for either the people living on the streets o…</a>]]></content:encoded>
