Dec 15th </p><p> ★ Come to the Press Conference before the Hearing on Tuesday! Social Distanced Press Conference and Breakfast Tuesday December 15th at 8am before the hearing at 20th and Champa. </p><p> ...<br /> We have an access number you can call to listen to the hearing December 15th and 16th starting 9am going all day. </p><p> For public audio access to the hearing, please call 877-336-1828 and enter access code 9449909#.</p><p> On December 15th and 16th, 2020, Federal District 10 Judge Martinez will be hearing our case against the City of Denver and the State of Colorado for violating constitutional rights by sweeping people without homes and with nowhere to go - even in a global pandemic. This suit demands that sweeps be halted, at least during the COVID pandemic, to protect the health and safety of the community with and without housing - as in line with CDC guidance. The suit states, “The CDC issued this guidance because conducting sweeps significantly increases the risk to homeless individuals, and the community, of infection with COVID-19. Despite this clear warning, the defendants chose to act in direct contradiction of public health guidance and to violate the property and due process rights of homeless individuals in a cruel and dangerous manner.” </p><p>  <br /> On top of this the suit addresses that, “Over the past year, and in a blatant effort to skirt a settlement agreement entered into between Denver and a class of its homeless population, Denver officials have repeatedly showed up at homeless encampments without notice, flatly told homeless residents to move along (“to where?” is the obvious question to this nonsensical command), and seized their property (often discarding it).” The City cannot get away with these violations of the lawsuit settlement agreement nor with the blatant disregard for the health of those who can’t afford housing during this pandemic. </p><p>  <br /> Plaintiffs for this case lost all their property in sweeps, including a mass sweep of Lincoln Park conducted by the City and State together on July 29th, 2020 with no notice. One plaintiff, Charles explains how after gathering all he could in one trip to move from the park that morning, that “when I returned to the spot where my tent had been, I found that it had been taken and destroyed by Denver officials, along with everything in it.” Hundreds of people lost all their property in that one sweep. These same hundreds of people have been chased around the City in sweep after sweep since that time. </p><p> Due to COVID regulations people will not be able to attend the hearing in person. You can call 877-336-1828 and enter access code 9449909# to listen to the hearing. We will also be holding a rally and press conference prior to Tuesday’s hearings at 8am outside the Alfred J. Arraj United States Courthouse (901 19th St - 20th and Champa) with safe distancing measures in place.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/2080262088770400">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/photos/a.271630356300258/2080261962103746/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/131426642_2080261965437079_5359694594643764931_o.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=tUXa7dLe0h8AX8XwFIq&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=563841797cb48da6dd5d2c56c27792b8&oe=5FFEA14C" alt="No photo description available." width="500" height="773" caption="No photo description available." /></a>]]></content:encoded>

"<br /> --------<br /> A lot of people try to do things that are unlikely. For example there are many who try to qualify for the Olympics, but only few do because the completion is so great. When they do we celebrate them.  </p><p> The challenge of qualifying for housing is similar. There is not enough housin...g for all those who need it.  So the competition to get into the available housing is great and few actually make it in.  Yet a statement like the one above makes it seem as if it is a processing issue and not an availability issue.  </p><p> The shelters are full.   <br /> The shelters are dangerous especially during Covid. </p><p> If housing was available people would be getting housed.   The lack of housing is why people are on the streets in the first place. <br /> So media typically discuss every thing except the most needed thing ACTUAL UNITS OF HOSUSING that people can live in insted of the street.   It will mean things like construction of budget housing (vs what realestale lobbyiests "market rate" aka "luxury"). </p><p> It will mean things like the construction of public housing.  <br /> (public housing is gov't subsidised housing. </p><p> BTW Budget housing is not gov't subsidised, and is availble on the market , one of our poblems in thehousing market is that no one builds budget housing and it is our reatest need.   </p><p> Rent control etc.  </p><p> All that is discussed what the service providers are doing because they are the ones that get the money instead of building or buying the units we need.</p><p> <a href="https://denverite.com/2020/11/28/denver-tries-a-new-approach-at-large-encampments-to-help-people-experiencing-homelessness/">https://denverite.com/…/denver-tries-a-new-approach-at-lar…/</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/2077709022359040">See More</a><a href="https://denverite.com/2020/11/28/denver-tries-a-new-approach-at-large-encampments-to-help-people-experiencing-homelessness/">As large encampments multiply in Denver, city workers conduct cleanup after cleanup that shift tent cities from one block to another, hardly a solution for either the people living on the streets o…<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQEVstNB3qCGPcmo&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fi0.wp.com%2Fwp-denverite.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F4%2F2020%2F11%2F201117-HOMELESSNESS-SWEEP-FIVE-POINTS-HOUSING-KEVINJBEATY-01.jpg%3Fresize%3D1200%252C630%26ssl%3D1&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQH1HfZfZAbMhGx7" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>denverite.com</p><p>Denver tries a new approach at large encampments to help people experiencing homelessness</p>As large encampments multiply in Denver, city workers conduct cleanup after cleanup that shift tent cities from one block to another, hardly a solution for either the people living on the streets o…<a href="https://denverite.com/2020/11/28/denver-tries-a-new-approach-at-large-encampments-to-help-people-experiencing-homelessness/">As large encampments multiply in Denver, city workers conduct cleanup after cleanup that shift tent cities from one block to another, hardly a solution for either the people living on the streets o…</a>]]></content:encoded>

Many of these residents moved to this area after the Arkins SWEEP. There were approximately 75+ people living there. One woman was tied down to a stretcher and taken by ambulance clearly against her consent. Then all of her belongings were trashed. One resident had her tents trashed while she was moving some of her belongings to the fence line as community volunteers are still being denied entry... into the fenced area. While volunteers and advocates were busy providing food, drink, supplies, and moving folks from 20th, 21st, Market and Blake, one man stood alone against 7 officers on 22nd and Wazee. Eventually, he was forced to move. Advocates arrived to witness the last tent which was unoccupied being trashed by DOTI.</p><p> And the City just keeps on SWEEPING. Tomorrow a SWEEP is posted for 7th and Lincoln. Another SWEEP is posted for Tuesday December 15, 2020 at 4th and Kalamath, the same day as our court hearing.</p><p> This insanity must stop! </p><p> Wanna get involved? Tomorrow DDPHE will have a public comment session. DDPHE is the Denver Department of Public Health one of the lead agencies in conducting SWEEPS. These are the guys who declare a public site as hazardous.
