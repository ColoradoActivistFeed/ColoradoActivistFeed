Our Mayor has sold out to corporate real-estate interests long ago. Interests that direct him to bully our homeless instead of helping them. <br /> -------------<br /> Some Comments from Dr. Calderon<br /> "Not even for a day can Mayor Hancock allow unhoused folks to have one small victory. It’s not enough that a federal judge is allowing his inhumane sweeps to continue. He also wants to take poor people’s property without notice as required by the Constitut...ion. <br /> Rather than provide housing, he’d rather punch down & drag poor folks back into court to force them into shelters during a pandemic. <br /> Normally, picking on the politically powerless would be considered bullying. But when you’re the Mayor of Denver using undisclosed taxpayer dollars on sweeps instead of housing during an economic & health crisis without any fiscal oversight, it’s just business as usual in the Hancock administration.<br /> “Attorneys for the city of Denver asked a federal appeals court Tuesday night to stop a federal ruling that requires city officials to give seven days’ notice before clearing most illegal homeless encampments.<br /> “The request comes a day after a ruling in a class-action lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court of Colorado in October that sought to stop the sweeps entirely. City attorneys filed an emergency motion Tuesday night to stay the decision, and also gave notice they’ll appeal the case in the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.<br /> “Besides the seven-day notice (shorter in certain circumstances), this week’s ruling mandated that city officials must also tell the attorney who filed the lawsuit, Andy McNulty, and the City Council member who represents the district when, where and why the sweeps will happen...<br /> “‘The city continues to throw good money after bad to defend these unconstitutional sweeps,’ McNulty said. ‘They know it doesn’t work. They know it’s not effective at solving the homelessness crisis in the city but they keep throwing resources at it in an attempt to placate political interests.’”</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/2119728268157115">See More</a><a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2021/01/26/denver-judge-homeless-sweeps-stay/">Attorneys for the city of Denver asked a federal appeals court Tuesday night to stop a federal ruling that requires city officials to give seven days’ notice before clearing most illegal homeless e…<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQFiU13faEr1aajL&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.denverpost.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F06%2FTDP-L-HC8_4680x.jpg%3Fw%3D1024%26h%3D683&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQGKSMAjhLqOYrHI" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>denverpost.com</p><p>Denver asks federal judge to stop order requiring 7 days’ notice before homeless sweeps</p>Attorneys for the city of Denver asked a federal appeals court Tuesday night to stop a federal ruling that requires city officials to give seven days’ notice before clearing most illegal homeless e…<a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2021/01/26/denver-judge-homeless-sweeps-stay/">Attorneys for the city of Denver asked a federal appeals court Tuesday night to stop a federal ruling that requires city officials to give seven days’ notice before clearing most illegal homeless e…</a>]]></content:encoded>

Yesterday (1/21/21) at 5th and Lincoln and today (1/22/22) at 6th and Broadway. <br /> Many of the residents of these encampments left prior to the City SWEEP. There were 3 remaining tents at 5th and Lincoln with 10 DPD officers present. There was 1 remaining resident at 6th and Broadway with a whopping 14 DPD officers present!! Here is a picture of a perfectly good tent at 5th and Lincoln being scooped up and thrown into the trash t...ruck.</p><p> There were 14 DPD officers present to traumatically displace ONE disabled man from 6th and Broaway. He didn't even have a tent.<br /> SWEEPS don't work! The folks at the 6th and Broadway camp all relocated within 2 blocks. OUR tax dollars would be better spent on HOUSING!!! Until then, our city needs to address the pandemic by providing trash and sanitation services to ALL residents. The game of whack-a-mole with humans has got to end.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/2112554092207866">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/photos/pcb.2112554092207866/2112553838874558/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/140171195_2112553842207891_52201446476087381_o.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=5Ve6xkcRjekAX9zMnNq&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=e3850c3ee548a3a4c2d5426a86fbc999&oe=6047E106" alt="May be an image of food and road" width="500" height="282" caption="May be an image of food and road" /></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/photos/pcb.2112554092207866/2112553948874547/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/140308350_2112553952207880_939317253627455397_o.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=Pqy82MKMTIoAX8exiTo&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=eb2bb72e3ae10165b68aff799db46ca8&oe=60456D6B" alt="May be an image of food and road" width="500" height="282" caption="May be an image of food and road" /></a>]]></content:encoded>

READ THE ARTICLE IT IS GOOD</p><p> "The city’s encampments persist, "<br /> Are we surprised? No available public housing, pandemic, economy based on low paying retail jobs... </p>...<p> "with tensions boiling over in Capitol Hill"<br /> Because they want homelessness to go away without having to be accountable to the needs of the poor... they just assume that if they can't see it they cant be bothered...</p><p> "Denver has opened two sanctioned camps"<br /> In the face of needing 50 camps did they really think these cute little photo ops was going to make a difference? The amount of housing that is available looks much like the amount of sanctioned encampments that are available. There is just not nearly enough to address the need. </p><p> " but they’re full."<br /> why would any one be surprised about this. </p><p> "Besides, some refuse to live there".<br /> They would rather be in their own place without a lot of oversight.<br /> And people coming by to take pitures and volunteer at the poor people zoo. You realize there is a lot of invasive (aka helpful) oversight in these sanctioned camps. Many people would just like to be left to their own business. They may be annoyed by required meetings that espouse ideologies they do not share, curfews that have no meaning to full adults adults etc</p><p> <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2021/01/20/homeless-encampments-in-denver/?utm_source=ActiveCampaign&utm_medium=email&utm_content=Democrats+in+charge+%2F+How+one+block+illustrates+Denver+s+homelessness+crisis+%2F+Xcel+Energy+wants+to+avoid+PG+E+s+fate&utm_campaign=The+Sunriser+-+1%2F20%2F2021&vgo_ee=zLePGw9i0ao926MAqfTGoEzkASpiHornD%2Fz2wZTd1jg%3D">https://coloradosun.com/…/…/homeless-encampments-in-denver/…</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/2111720728957869">See More</a><a href="https://coloradosun.com/2021/01/20/homeless-encampments-in-denver/?utm_source=ActiveCampaign&utm_medium=email&utm_content=Democrats+in+charge+%2F+How+one+block+illustrates+Denver+s+homelessness+crisis+%2F+Xcel+Energy+wants+to+avoid+PG+E+s+fate&utm_campaign=The+Sunriser+-+1%2F20%2F2021&vgo_ee=zLePGw9i0ao926MAqfTGoEzkASpiHornD%2Fz2wZTd1jg%3D">“I’m going to shoot him!” The man’s shouts echoed in the street at 2 a.m. as he rummaged through his belongings for a gun.
