Since in person school is scheduled to start at that location on September 28th, most residents of this encampment believe it might not be the best place to stay once school is in session. However, this does not mean the 60 or more residents of this camp can be expected to ju...st disappear with this sweep. </p><p> Residents of this encampment are demanding that City officials choice between the following options:</p><p> Provide housing or hotel rooms to all residents of this encampment (at least through winter...but then with permanent housing connection) </p><p> Open an SOS site in the area immediately where all residents of this encampment can stay</p><p> Let former residents of this encampment be (without sweeps and police) wherever reasonable spots they move to</p><p> The City should reply to residents with which option they are choosing by Monday (9/21) so residents know where they will be moving to on Tuesday. City officials can make this announcement directly delivered to the camp in writing, or send it to info&#064;denverhomelessoutloud.org and we will deliver it to residents for the City. </p><p> If the City needs assistance finding housing or hotels for the roughly 60 residents of this encampment, they need look no farther than the thousands of vacant luxury apartments and hotels. The City can hold master leases on apartments and rent those to people according to their income. They can also set up long term leases at hotels as they move forward in buying vacant hotels. </p><p> Homelessness ends with a home. This is possible. The time is now.

Can we make it to 25k??!</p><p> It is half way through September and we have made just over $14,000 toward maintaining our Sanitation Stations at encampments!! That is huge!!! THANK YOU SOOO MUCH to all of you who have donated to make this possible! With this amount we can pay for at least September and October. If we make another $11,000 by the end of this month we will have enough to pay for these services at the 5 encamp...ments we are currently serving for the rest of 2020! </p><p> What does this pay for exactly?? Five portable toilets serviced 5 days a week, moving charges after police sweeps, pay for a resident of the encampment to do an extra cleaning of the portable toilet each day, cleaning supplies, and some of the supplies to maintain the handwashing stations (done together with Mutual Aid Denver). </p><p> Again, we must note, this should be the city’s responsibility. The city currently has a contract with Liberty Waste that could pay for portable toilets and handwashing stations at every encampment around town. CDC guidance tells cities to provide these sanitation resources to every encampment of 10 people or more. But they continue to ignore our demand that this basic human resource be provided. We will continue to make this demand heard…</p><p> In the meanwhile… your donations to pay for toilets and handwashing ensures at least 5 encampments, totaling at least 350 people, have access to a toilet and soap and water to wash their hands. Something every person needs and deserves. </p><p> Please share this call for donations with your friends and family!  </p><p> You can donate on paypal, check, or with cash as laid out on this link.</p><p> <a href="https://denverhomelessoutloud.org/donate/">https://denverhomelessoutloud.org/donate/</a></p><p>  </p><p> If you donate, please note "for sanitation resources" so we can keep track of the fund coming for this need. </p><p>  </p><p> Please contact us with any questions, donations, or ongoing funding. </p><p>  </p><p> We are over half way toward funding these services for the rest of 2020… let's make this happen!!</p><p>  </p><p> Contact us at: </p><p> info&#064;denverhomelessoutloud.org</p><p> 720-940-5291</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/1993088597487750">See More</a><p>denverhomelessoutloud.org</p><p>Donate</p>Here are some ways you can help with the finances… 1.

The others still remain homeless.</p><p> With all the lies Hancock has spouted about the cities intent in the past do you really think we can afford to believe him now?  We need 50 or so of these camps to meet the need.  One in basically every neighboorhood.  Hancock has stated the city  wants to set up 2 or 3 camps.  In light of the need for at least 50 of these to meet the need can they be considered anything but  “photo op” camps?</p><p> What about those who cannont squeeze in?  Expect them to be crimiminalized harshly.   And that will be the majority of our homeless population.   </p><p> As far as the site in the article, it was slated to receive notification for a sweep a little over a week ago.  They called the sweep it off last min due to the weather event last week and some prodding of the folks working on setting the first SOS camp up.  Think about it, the 1st welcoming sanctioned place was going to get swept to make it a “welcoming”place for the homeless.   Perhaps the people who are already there are not the “right kind” of homeless people.  Which, if you think about, it begins to sound racist.  Homelessness always have a heavy dose of racism mixed in.  <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/09/12/mayor-hancock-homeless-campsite/">https://www.denverpost.com/…/mayor-hancock-homeless-campsi…/</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/1992189524244324">See More</a><a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/09/12/mayor-hancock-homeless-campsite/">Mayor Michael Hancock said a small strip of city-owned property between Sonny Lawson Park and the Blair-Caldwell Library could a possible place for individuals to set up campsites in a controlled e…<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDFkAfpHLLIT2xM&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.denverpost.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F06%2FTDP-L-MAYOR-HANCOCK-PRESSER-PROTESTERS_JAC1203x.jpg%3Fw%3D1024%26h%3D772&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQC2PTpq_7GQK_af" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>denverpost.com</p><p>Denver identifies possible designated campsite for those experiencing homelessness</p>Mayor Michael Hancock said a small strip of city-owned property between Sonny Lawson Park and the Blair-Caldwell Library could a possible place for individuals to set up campsites in a controlled e…<a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/09/12/mayor-hancock-homeless-campsite/">Mayor Michael Hancock said a small strip of city-owned property between Sonny Lawson Park and the Blair-Caldwell Library could a possible place for individuals to set up campsites in a controlled e…</a>]]></content:encoded>

Some of these people moved back the night after the swe...ep, others a few days after, but in any case folks have been living on these blocks since the sweep with no indication that the area is “closed.” </p><p> At least 6 people will show up today to find all their property gone. One of these people, Van, showed up shortly after the police had just trashed, not stored, his tent and all his property. This is the same man who stood his ground against the police on one leg at the sweep two weeks ago. All of the residents of this area are scattered to nowhere...</p><p> After coming in and taking these people’s property around 12noon, one resident - David - showed up on site as the city was about to grab his property. The police agreed to give him two hours to pack and move. Just after 2pm police showed up, walked up and arrested Daivd at 2:14pm for “disobeying a lawful order” aka being 6 minutes late to move his property as he was actively in the midst of moving his property. Police did not give him any warning or any time when they walked up on him at 2:14pm to arrest him. They just threw him in handcuffs and told him he was under arrest. </p><p> A few minutes later, another man - Allen - who had just had his property taken from the city two hours earlier and walked up to it being gone, came back to the area since we had found someone to give him a ride to try to get his stuff from storage and he was immediately arrested. Police claimed he was on body camera footage threatening an officer and arrested him for “threats to an officer.” This same officer who he supposedly threatened, was caught on camera pushing his car door into Allen and grabbing his arm and pushing him back. This was all as Allen was trying to ask officers for business cards after his property had just been taken. Two hours later police proceeded to arrest him with great force and had him on the ground for over 30 minutes. </p><p> You don’t have to look any farther to see the intersection of racism, homelessness, and police brutality. Police arrested these men for NOTHING because that is what police do to homeless black people. Enough is enough.</p><p> Thanks to community members who are bailing these men out of jail. </p><p> Watch livestream and others on our facebook of these sweeps and arrests <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/videos/716517545872124/">https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/videos/716517545872124</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/1988439837952626">See More</a><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t15.13418-10/119105525_402008110787160_2075018125510989478_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&_nc_sid=f2c4d5&_nc_ohc=ePb1S0B-GsMAX-XolVb&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&oh=65a29fc6679839608060ceb012238772&oe=5F8E042C" /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/">Denver Homeless Out Loud</a> was live.<a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/videos/716517545872124/"></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com"><i></i></a>]]></content:encoded>
