Two others are set to open within days, with more likely to come.</p><p> It’s a controversial strategy that’s sparked pushback from neighbors worried about safety, and from activists who argue the camps are neither humane nor sufficient for the scope of the problem. But proponents, including Mayor London Breed, say they’re the best option available. And while other major Bay Area cities mostly have avoided adopting city-organized encampments for years — despite their expanding homeless populations — some outreach workers say it’s time to embrace the inevitable."</p><p> <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/05/26/amid-coronavirus-are-sanctioned-tent-cities-the-answer-to-homelessness/">https://www.mercurynews.com/…/amid-coronavirus-are-sanctio…/</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/2154307821365826">See More</a><a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/05/26/amid-coronavirus-are-sanctioned-tent-cities-the-answer-to-homelessness/">San Francisco is opening city-organized homeless camps — a big shift for a city that, pre-pandemic, prioritized eliminating tent cities.<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQF6ZC0FuCvbSujT&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mercurynews.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F05%2FSJM-L-LAWYERS-05XX-3.jpg%3Fw%3D1024%26h%3D638&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&ccb=3-4&_nc_hash=AQGlckyYAmCNbyGg" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>mercurynews.com</p><p>Amid coronavirus, are sanctioned tent cities the answer to Bay Area homelessness?</p>San Francisco is opening city-organized homeless camps — a big shift for a city that, pre-pandemic, prioritized eliminating tent cities.<a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/05/26/amid-coronavirus-are-sanctioned-tent-cities-the-answer-to-homelessness/">San Francisco is opening city-organized homeless camps — a big shift for a city that, pre-pandemic, prioritized eliminating tent cities.</a>]]></content:encoded>

There is a small camp outside of their office and wanted some assistance with some issues they were having. I went to the camp. I know the residents there well. Very well. I spoke with them, then went into Wedlocks to speak to the owner. Michelle who goes by "Nine" was relieved to see me after reaching out for help. We talked a bit. She was told by DPD not to engage with the camp resid...ents, advice she followed which she now regrets. She felt like things had gotten out of hand and she didn't know how to real it back in. I asked her how I could help. She wanted to find common ground and have some agreements around coexisting. I offered to facilitate a conversation with her and the camp residents. We went outside and had a chat. They got to know a little bit about one another and then hashed out some agreements. They agreed to work together for their mutual survival (residents and business together). When I left they were all sitting on the sidewalk in a circle talking and laughing. Another way is possible and we can all be part of the solution. Choice is yours.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/2153829578080317">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/photos/a.271630356300258/2153829471413661/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/160980437_2153829474746994_1244869026409818840_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=sLr3Y9MfPRkAX-8lIYv&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=7e6cc9c4e1d6c18893bfdc48cbb14550&oe=607AFAB5" alt="May be an image of one or more people and outdoors" width="500" height="282" caption="May be an image of one or more people and outdoors" /></a>]]></content:encoded>

The last two residents who remained by 9am—independent women of color well-known in the community—have been swept 5+ times in the past 6 months. City workers were rushing, or just didn’t care, because as Didi wheeled one of her carts outside the fenced-in area, EHS and their bobcat scooped up her cooler and other storage bins, crushing them in the 2 minutes it took her to return.</p><p> On Wednesday, the city demolished 5 small, well-maintained camps (50+ people) in the Baker neighborhood. This sprawling operation brought out 19 police officers, but only 4 mental health workers. The worst moments? A city employee (EHS) mocking a resident during a mental health episode, an EHS supervisor threatening to “beat your ass” to a resident who wasn’t packing up fast enough. That SAME supervisor later stole an axe from a resident, and was recorded putting it in his truck. There was an attempted illegal sweep of 3 indigenous folx outside the posted eviction area. All this heinous shit was caught on camera.</p><p> On Thursday, the curbside camp of ~25 people at Colfax and Washington was obliterated. Nearby business owners - Argonaut Wine & Liquor and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/chebahut/">Cheba Hut "Toasted" Subs</a> - called the cops on mutual aid workers, advocates, and members of the press for “trespassing” in the empty lots outside the fences. We were physically threatened by testosterone-drunk security guards working for a private firm called Ronin Asset Protection. Before the sweep was even over, employees from Argonaut Liquors installed anti-homeless fencing on the whole block.</p><p> Two weeks ago, at least 5 people froze to death, another 30 landed in burn wards, many losing fingers and toes. DestabilizIng 100+ people before an even bigger storm is appalling, but Mayor Hancock and his gang of cops & contractors clearly care more about corporate interests and property than human lives.</p><p> Fuck all of this.<br /> STOP THE SWEEPS</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

The Mayors office takes every opportunity in those instances to muddle it up. (As demonstrated in the testimony) We for sure we were interested in what was said at the time and were glued to our phones listening in (as provided by the court). Being able to review hours of testimony without having to wait weeks and pay for transcripts is helpful. The Allies to Abolitionists recording has been helpful in trying to keep the Mayors off...ices manipulation tactics in check.  We can repeat the things they testified to and can draw on all the testimony rather than small snippets of what we can remember.  </p><p> BTW</p><p> But wasn't the OJ trial on TV? <br /> What is the difference? [other than it was not Federal Court]<br /> Was it because it was a rich and famous guy generating public support for his cause as his trial goes vs in this case we have poor homeless not getting the same opportunity.</p><p> The Mayors office has been adversarial all along the way, every step of the way. imagine how good things would be for the city if they fought for the people the way the fight for the real-estate developers. </p><p> <a href="https://www.westword.com/news/colorado-court-hearing-recording-homeless-documentary-denver-11908681?fbclid=IwAR2CLHD9MxkmzzLpJtRDIj7srAOIhE6JqjHr6hq3YuKTv8Ucfl7tNsNMiig">https://www.westword.com/…/colorado-court-hearing-recording…</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/2150332878429987">See More</a><a href="https://www.westword.com/news/colorado-court-hearing-recording-homeless-documentary-denver-11908681">The audio plays a starring role in a new documentary.<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQHH_kf72Owp0iNP&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages1.westword.com%2Fimager%2Fu%2Foriginal%2F11909485%2Fyoutube_screenshot.png&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&ccb=3-4&_nc_hash=AQH5WRJSYMb8GAGi" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>westword.com</p><p>Does the Public Have a Right to Record a Homeless Sweeps Court Hearing?</p>The audio plays a starring role in a new documentary.<a href="https://www.westword.com/news/colorado-court-hearing-recording-homeless-documentary-denver-11908681">The audio plays a starring role in a new documentary.</a>]]></content:encoded>

There is a Federal Judge that granted an injunction while we await a lawsuit against the city for relocating people with out a plan and making up excuses with out data about why such behavior is ok.  </p><p> In the mean time our homeless neighbors will need some help with relocation.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/2144749728988302">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/photos/a.271630356300258/2144749632321645/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/156207814_2144749635654978_1045036066253520632_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=9rpPyiKYip8AX_u3PQI&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=e97d379e747b0db55c8e78c3449332af&oe=6079A2F2" alt="May be an image of text that says 'HOUSEKEYS NOT SWEEPS'" width="500" height="643" caption="May be an image of text that says 'HOUSEKEYS NOT SWEEPS'" /></a>]]></content:encoded>
