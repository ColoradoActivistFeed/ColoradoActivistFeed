"I find it hypocritical that Hancock is using the pandemic as some sort of shield to testify, when just two weeks ago he was flying across the country for Thanksgiving," he says.<br /> ----------</p>...<p> The same mayor who is to busy to see the federal Judge on the sweeps case<br /> during business hours with a job he can delegate day to day stuff to.. has plenty of thine to fly out of state to visit family when he tell everyone else to stay put. Time to face the Music nasty man. Perhaps he is so use to lying that he knows he will lie in front of the Judge and that would lead to serous consequences. Like contempt of court charges.  We already know the Judge is not happy with the cities attitude in this case as the Judge stated during testimony in the Lyall vs Denver case.  You are not going to be able to order around the Federal Judge the way you do the city attorney.  </p><p> <a href="https://www.westword.com/news/colorado-governor-denver-mayor-try-to-avoid-testifying-in-federal-homeless-case-11856147?fbclid=IwAR2vanLHDCYqWRdbZ3PGCGEH2ymUQANrU6yfyfnnSLrrKT9Vx32IElpbsSo">https://www.westword.com/…/colorado-governor-denver-mayor-t…</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/2072540599542549">See More</a><a href="https://www.westword.com/news/colorado-governor-denver-mayor-try-to-avoid-testifying-in-federal-homeless-case-11856147">The case has a hearing this month.<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQA4Hi-Vpl2QyGt-&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages1.westword.com%2Fimager%2Fu%2Foriginal%2F11856257%2F11302020homeless-sweep026.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQCIMAKAgWxFumww" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>westword.com</p><p>Hancock, Polis Try to Avoid Testifying in Homeless-Sweeps Lawsuit</p>The case has a hearing this month.<a href="https://www.westword.com/news/colorado-governor-denver-mayor-try-to-avoid-testifying-in-federal-homeless-case-11856147">The case has a hearing this month.</a>]]></content:encoded>

This suit demands that sweeps be halted, at least during the COVID pandemic, to protect the health and safety of the community with and without housing - as in line with CDC guidance. The suit states, “The CDC issued this guidance because conducting sweeps significantly increases the risk to homeless individuals, and the community, of infection with COVID-19. Despite this clear warning, the defendants chose to act in direct contradiction of public health guidance and to violate the property and due process rights of homeless individuals in a cruel and dangerous manner.” </p><p> On top of this the suit addresses that, “Over the past year, and in a blatant effort to skirt a settlement agreement entered into between Denver and a class of its homeless population, Denver officials have repeatedly showed up at homeless encampments without notice, flatly told homeless residents to move along (“to where?” is the obvious question to this nonsensical command), and seized their property (often discarding it).” The City cannot get away with these violations of the lawsuit settlement agreement nor with the blatant disregard for the health of those who can’t afford housing during this pandemic. </p><p> Plaintiffs for this case lost all their property in sweeps, including a mass sweep of Lincoln Park conducted by the City and State together on July 29th, 2020 with no notice. One plaintiff, Charles explains how after gathering all he could in one trip to move from the park that morning, that “when I returned to the spot where my tent had been, I found that it had been taken and destroyed by Denver officials, along with everything in it.” Hundreds of people lost all their property in that one sweep. These same hundreds of people have been chased around the City in sweep after sweep since that time. </p><p> Due to COVID regulations people will not be able to attend the hearing in person. There will be a call-in number where the public can listen to the hearing. Stay tuned for this number. We will also be holding a rally and press conference prior to the hearings at 8am outside the Alfred J. Arraj United States Courthouse (901 19th St - 20th and Champa) with safe distancing measures in place.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/2070747546388521">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/photos/a.271630356300258/2070747469721862/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/128632132_2070747473055195_5083384743138947795_o.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=yineKmbOljAAX94Lw_D&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=f91780677a9fb562a40380fa1ba0d815&oe=5FF50556" alt="No photo description available." width="500" height="773" caption="No photo description available." /></a>]]></content:encoded>

Last night residents of the camp were told they could not get back into their property - some slept right outside the fence with what they had. Others scattered to who knows where without their property. Others were told they could go in, but if they came back out they could not get back in to get the rest of their prop...erty. In the morning, starting around 6am, the City started trashing property - indiscriminately scooping property with bulldozers and bobcats and crains. Anyone who had their property there but was not allowed in lost all their property. One of the only people who got their property today was a woman we helped get back in to get her stuff just before they were about to trash it. </p><p> After the sweep today, police went to numerous other camps around town - many where residents from Arkins moved to - telling them they could not be there under camping ban enforcement. People trying to move from the Arkins sweep were stopped from setting up at various camps - including cops threatening volunteers helping folks move with “illegal dumping” if they unloaded the person’s property. </p><p> On top of all this, 13th and Elati was just posted for a sweep next Tuesday, December 8th. This camp has roughly 50 people and is about have way made up of people who moved from their from the downtown library sweep a couple weeks ago.</p><p> This shit must end.</p><p> Contact:<br /> info&#064;denverhomelessoutloud.org<br /> 720-940-5291</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/2069043679892241">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/photos/a.271630356300258/2069042853225657/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/129188592_2069042856558990_5533034783630387315_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=6X1B_l6Uqr0AX8YpwYB&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=62e97803ccb4e9853d053adf7d43a5ba&oe=5FF5AF79" alt="Image may contain: one or more people and outdoor" width="500" height="667" caption="Image may contain: one or more people and outdoor" /></a>]]></content:encoded>

But the simple presence of a needle justifies the disposal of a tent, according to city guidelines"<br /> ------------<br /> The guidelines also state they can throw a tent away for the simple appearance partially eaten food left in a tent. Almost every tent will have a half eaten sandwich or other food they were saving for later.  It gives the city an excuse to toss everything with out looking very har...d. So why would they substitute a referee to something that everyone does – eat food- with something a small minority of people do – intravenous drugs-.  I will offer that they are trying to shame these folks in any way possible so you (the general public) allow their cruelty to these people.  </p><p> BTW after contacting 100 people no one was housed. (or they would be declaring it and bragging about how many they housed) One person we are aware of got a 72 hour hotel voucher.

It is all about the money and the news is not reporting it. </p>...<p> I will say for his part Rick did call looking for permision to use some footage from an independent news outlet that he thought we might be able to connect him with.  The footage was of a person who was arrested while praying. How about asking a few of the most obvious questions about why all this is happening in the first place?  </p><p> - Why now after over a year?<br /> - Why now during the peak of a pandemic? <br /> - Anything happening near by that is posted on the property?<br /> - What does that big yellow sign talking about a zoning<br /> meeting in 2 weeks mean in regards to the timing of the sweep? <br /> Could they have waited until the vacines come out before sweeping?  They waited a year already. <br /> - Isn't that dangerous for the city let alone against CDC guidelines?</p><p> Basic investigative type questions.  </p><p> Nope. Unfortunately our local news does not take the time to investigate.  Too busy selling that advertising.  Now let me tell you about the new tikle me Elmo it only cost 19.99$ hurry supplies are limited.
