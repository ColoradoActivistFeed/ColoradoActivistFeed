There has been close collaboration between residents of the encampment and library staff. Until the last few weeks, the number of encampment residents was kept around 15 or 20 so as to fit in the best space available next to the library. But after recent sweeps of multiple encampments from nearby areas, this Blair-caldwell encampment naturally grew as others had nowhere to go. Now there are at least 50 people living here...and they are being told to scatter scram. </p><p>  </p><p> This is also the same site that was recently proposed for a Safe Outdoor Site that the Mayor originally approved and then pulled his support last minute after a Business Improvement District spoke against it. A vision of what it could look like to have this very site be a living space for around 40 people has already been shown and approved by City departments like fire, water, and DDPHE, and yet, just because the Mayor cares more about business interests than people’s lives, this is not happening and all these people living here will be scattered to no where. </p><p>  </p><p> Residents of this encampment include many elderly disabled people, young people who work full time jobs, people who can’t go to shelters due to previous abuse by other guests, people who have lived on the streets for years sitting on housing wait lists, and more.  </p><p>  </p><p> This is the third sweep scheduled for this week - in spite of the cold and snow. </p><p>  </p><p> This insanity and inhumanity must end. </p><p>  </p><p> Please come and support our unhoused community members at Blair-Caldwell Library as they demand real housing or places where they are allowed to survive - while being forced to nowhere by the City.</p><p>  </p><p> Bring the following things to assist residents:</p><p> -Truck, or any vehicle to help move</p><p> -Carts</p><p> -Bungee Cords</p><p> -Rope</p><p> -Trash Bags</p><p> -Food</p><p> -Coffee/CoCo</p><p> -Water</p><p> Your assistance is much appreciated!

Oh there is so much more.   But would love to hear you comments.<br /> ----------------<br />  &#064;3:15 It is possible the the rate at which homelessness is increasing just that much faster than the increasd spending can keep up with.   He mentions no data that there is a portion of folks who have been housed that are losing that housing adding to the numbers of ...folk becomeing homeless.  But he sure make is seem that way.  All these “supportive” services will not make more housing availibe to meet the need for increased number of people becoming homeless.   </p><p> He failed to metinon that wait times on housing lists have doubled during that period (or thereabouts) .  Revealing a lack of supply to trasition people into in the first place.  Being Marbuts background is making money as a service provier he porbaly has ways to profit or ways to set up his friends for profit by putting the money into services instead of housing.  </p><p> Lets see the data on the failure rate of folks housed after 2013 and compare it to those housed before 2013.  If there is no apreciable change the obious conclusion is that our society is just creating homeless folks faster than we can house them...  even with increases in spending.  </p><p> Remember, in places that are gentrifying, housing costs are nearly doubled since 2013 and thus more 2 times more expensive to house that same person.  Those gentrifying areas are also the area where unsheltered homelessnes is increasing the most. He has not referenced that in his opening statement about how much it cost to house someone in 2013 vs now.   </p><p> Have wages for front line service providers doubled in that time?   What about the wages of directors and CEOs of those same service providers.  This has the potential of siphoning off federal money for housing to a handful of individuals profiting off the non profit industrial complex fattening their paycheck.  Expect no data on these things to be available of questions raised on them to be answered directly.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/2029408907189052">See More</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKk6FHaQM6U&feature=youtu.be">“In a Nation as prosperous as ours, we can work together to lift our neighbors up off the streets and eradicate the threat of homelessness,” said HUD Secreta...<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQAIeBIUbPG6icXm&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FKKk6FHaQM6U%2Fmaxresdefault_live.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQBsFqU0OUrTG2Q9" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>youtube.com</p><p>HUD Discussion on Federal Government’s Response to Homelessness</p>“In a Nation as prosperous as ours, we can work together to lift our neighbors up off the streets and eradicate the threat of homelessness,” said HUD Secreta...<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKk6FHaQM6U&feature=youtu.be">“In a Nation as prosperous as ours, we can work together to lift our neighbors up off the streets and eradicate the threat of homelessness,” said HUD Secreta...</a>]]></content:encoded>

Many people have been living here for months with the agreement of the Library. They have been working collaboratively with the Library to keep the area clean and safe. In recent weeks more people have moved here after being swept from other nearby encampments. Instead of wo...rking with new residents of this area on maintaining the space, the fire department has been sent to attempt to lump all residents in the same boat and kick everyone out. The fire department specifically quotes two issues that need resolved: combustible materials near the windows, and maintaining clear passage of the egress. These issues are both resolvable while residents of tents continue to live there. </p><p> In fact, only weeks ago this very location was approved by the fire department for a SOS site (tent camp). The current residents of this area should be held to the same fire safety standards as the approved SOS camp - not indiscriminately evicted regardless of their compliance with fire code. </p><p> Come down to Blair-Caldwell Library tomorrow morning (Tuesday 10/20) to ensure residents are treated in accordance to fair codes and not displaced even when they are following these codes.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/2026734490789827">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/photos/a.271630356300258/2026734434123166/"><img src="https://scontent-den4-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/122178016_2026734437456499_8425280701291261119_o.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=aDE-Xw5c-dIAX-C4Nga&_nc_ht=scontent-den4-1.xx&tp=6&oh=1bc4a8799d2c1740af411610883c2932&oe=5FBEFC89" alt="No photo description available." width="500" height="667" caption="No photo description available." /></a>]]></content:encoded>

They have done this multiple times involving multiple units. They also have orders placed to move the remaining units, without notifying us.   </p><p> These are the very units you as a community, donated money fo...r though a fundraiser we ran to support the cost of these units through the rest of 2020!!!  </p><p> They are doing this in spite of CDC guidance, which asks cities to leave encampments in place to help prevent the spread of Covid and to provide port-a-potties to all encampments. Instead the city continually puts the rest of the city at risk by moving these encampments from place to place and now stealing the port-a-potties we put there!&#064;#  </p><p> They claim these units are unsanitary. Have you seen the city sponsored equivalents? They are in far worse sanitary condition. </p><p> Contact DDPHE Matt Wilmes - matthew.wilmes&#064;denvergov.org or 720-865-6880</p><p> 1) Demand that DDPHE cease this theft of port-a-potties WE have paid for. </p><p> 2) Contact your Council person with the same demand. </p><p> 3)  Ask for a written response back.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/2026597904136819">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/photos/a.271630356300258/2026597764136833/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/121719086_2026597767470166_2251932294625785432_o.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=Ae4VbzG7oTgAX9BmhsJ&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=b161583f61389bd3ae28162f857d0bf6&oe=5FBE0B32" alt="Image may contain: outdoor" width="500" height="376" caption="Image may contain: outdoor" /></a>]]></content:encoded>
