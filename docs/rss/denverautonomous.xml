Naturally, this was an extremely traumatizing event, and I preferred to spare the details from the world partly for privacy but mostly for shame. What they did to me was not only cruel and unusual, but I would even go so far as to call those men’s actions that night pure evil. But tonight I am forced to share with you all this in hopes you will stand in solidarity with me as I stand trial against felony charges that could land me years in prison. It would mean the world to me if you all could take a few minutes to read this and repost my story if you feel comfortable with that.</p><p> The reason I feel forced to share my story, or even share prematurely is because of the circumstances of this trial. The night of the protest I was arrested for “disarming a peace officer” - they say I stole a pepper ball gun from one of the officers. Disclaimer, I didn't… but I’ll get to that later - After being discharged from jail due to my deteriorating medical condition, I quickly found an excellent law firm to help represent me. Over the next 4 weeks, my legal team visited DPD twice a day, requesting all the evidence such as footage from a street surveillance camera, and the officer's body cams. When they did not comply, I turned to my friends in the political realm. After a few state legislators reached out on my behalf, for the most part we were met with silence. As privileged as I was to have these politicians advocating for me, DPD still would not budge. The only discovery presented by the police so far, 6 weeks after my arrest, is a probable cause statement-making claims that can be quickly and easily disproved by a video of the arrest that night, provided by a fellow protestor. In all the years my lawyers have been practicing in Colorado, they have never once seen evidence be withheld to such a degree. And with all the stories of shady arrests going down, it is honestly starting to scare me.</p><p> Unfortunately, now I know what a panic attack feels like. I now know the tight squeezing feeling that grips my chest, that the doctors call anxiety. The fact that I can't live without an irrational fear of being outside alone at night (something women have ALWAYS to deal with!!!!). The reason for this is because of the exact way the arrest went down that night. It was without any warning nor any chance to cooperate. I was grabbed from behind while I was standing, leaning against a fence. What happened next occurred in the blink of an eye. I was thrown to the ground face first. All of a sudden I started getting beaten by several officers, kicked and hit with a baton. I was grabbed by the hair on my scalp, my head was lifted off the ground, and I was punched multiple times in the face. My muffled screams for my girlfriend, for any help, were quickly snuffed out. Then an officer decided to take his baton, and forcibly shove it into my rectum. My “fight or flight, friend or freeze” instincts kicked in, and my body went numb. Everything that happened after that felt like a blur. I begged and pleaded for them to tell me what I had done wrong and why I was being arrested, but the only response I received was being told “We don’t gotta tell you SHIT… shut the FUCK up”</p><p> After spending the night in the hospital concussed and handcuffed to my gurney, I was finally thrown in jail. The worst of my charges: disarming an officer??? and violently resisting arrest?!? All absolutely untrue. I did not do it, and there is a video that shows all of this. My deepest gratitude goes out to the unnamed protestor who reached out with the video. I am not a violent man. Peace is my first language, anyone who knows me can tell you that.</p><p> These officers must face the law. I still don't even know the names of my assaulters. They remain anonymous, STILL ON DUTY. How long until they sexually assault another victim, or even murder someone. How long until another “hashtag”.</p><p> Please share this. If you feel comfortable, even share a short story, or some time you have personally witnessed the amount of love I pour into activism, and this community… I live to help. Tag Jared Polis. Tag Mayor Hancock. Tag DA Beth Mccann, DPD, tag em all. Community, I need you all now more than ever. I love you all. Thank you.</p><p> Link to video of arrest: <a href="https://streamable.com/3pn8wa">https://streamable.com/3pn8wa</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

Last night, in a last-minute mobilization, 125 gathered with Antonio Blackbear’s mother, wife, daughter, aunt, and other relative...s to protest his murder by Denver Police two days ago.</p><p> We began with an Indigenous prayer and remarks from family members, including Lynn Eagle Feather, Antonio’s hunka (adopted) aunt, whose son, Paul Castaway, was also murdered by Denver Police five years ago. </p><p> With friendly cars following us, we marched a mile from the Capitol Building past the downtown police headquarters and chanted “Cops! Pigs! Murderers!” at the cops guarding the fence they erected around it. We asked them, “Which one of you killed Antonio Blackbear?” and later, when we confronted some sheriff’s deputies, “Which one of you killed Michael Marshall?”</p><p> At the site of Antonio’s murder, family members gathered around a candle-filled memorial and told the crowd about their lost relative. Antonio’s mother expressed how touched she was by the presence of so many who were outraged by the shooting. It was painful to witness yet another family reeling from the shock of the police taking the life of their beloved relative.</p><p> The march returned to the Capitol and happened to pass a Starbucks along the way, the windows of which proved to be an irresistible temptation. After most of us had dispersed and gone home, two truckloads of riot cops advanced on those that remained. They were clearly coming for a couple of protestors and we were unable to prevent them from doing so. Two were arrested and won’t be able to be bailed out until Monday. Donations for bail can be made to Colorado Freedom Fund: <a href="https://fundly.com/coloradofreedom">https://fundly.com/coloradofreedom</a></p><p> Thank you to Antonio’s family, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nativelivesmatter1/">Native Lives Matter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AnonResistanceMovement/">Anon Resistance Movement</a>, and all who showed up against racist police violence!</p><p> “When Indigenous lives are under attack, what do we do?

Last Wednesday, when 40+ DPD officers brutalized community members assisting unhoused neighbors with sweeps, we drew a line in the sand. Enough is enough!</p><p> We demand justice for our unhoused neighbors, as well as the families of William Debose, Alexis Mendez-Perez, Paul Castaway, Michael Marshall, Marvin Booker, Ryan Ronquillo, Jessie Hernandez and the thousands of people in our city impacted by state-backed violence. The Denver City Council has failed to hear our calls for justice, liberation and abolition. We know that human rights only come alive when citizens organize, protest, boycott, rebel and violate the law in order to uphold justice!</p><p> Twelve comrades were arrested last night. Some were released on PR bond but we still have 3 bonds of $500 each to pay and two comrades with bond not allowed until court on Monday afternoon. Please help raise the ransom for these brave rebels and get them out of cages with an active COVID outbreak! Let's get our comrades back to their loved ones, their pets and their jobs tonight!</p><p> As the election approaches, we are looking to make an active bail fund for rebels. Any excess monies will be put into this revolving fund as we work to create it! We will update this post when fundraising goals gave been met!</p><p> Solidarity & Power"<br /> ✊🏴🚩🔥</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverautonomous/posts/3263594710369967">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverautonomous/photos/a.820058771390252/3263581947037910/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/118229396_3263581950371243_8170758790668721699_o.png?_nc_cat=111&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=YG2zgQIyCukAX8p9A28&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&oh=3bcee7ef05099e3ecad43202607960df&oe=5F885ED1" alt="Image may contain: text that says 'GIVE EM HELL BAIL FUND SUPPORT DENVER'S ANTI POLICE PROTESTORS ARRESTED AUGUST 22 VENMO: &#064;LOVELIONHIPPOPOTAMUS'" width="500" height="500" caption="Image may contain: text that says 'GIVE EM HELL BAIL FUND SUPPORT DENVER'S ANTI POLICE PROTESTORS ARRESTED AUGUST 22 VENMO: &#064;LOVELIONHIPPOPOTAMUS'" /></a>]]></content:encoded>

This means they will very likely come tomorrow (Wednesday 8/5) to try and sweep everyone out. We cannot stand for this continued whack-a-mole “solution” to homelessness. As is stated in the CDC guidance, if you cannot offer individual housing options for everyone, you should not sweep people along...with nowhere to go. </p><p> Make your demand heard tomorrow morning by showing up to 13th and Clarkson at 7am to stand up for housing, not sweeps. </p><p> School is not starting in person until October at the earliest. We should be using these months to get folks housing or at least another stable place encampments with necessary sanitation resources. Not to sweep people off to some other block to face the fear of being swept again and again and again…</p><p> Things to bring:</p><p> -Signs demanding housing not sweeps</p><p> -Breakfast food or coffee</p><p> -Your voice and body to stand against inhumanity!&#064;#</p><p> Stay tuned for updates if anything does go down today...</p><p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/housingnotsweeps">#HousingNotSweeps</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/movealongtowhere">#MoveAlongToWhere</a>??</p><p> Contact:</p><p> info&#064;denverhomelessoutloud.org</p><p> 720-940-5291</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>
