But this is really about trying to reach the people who likely need improvements most and aren’t able to show up or, you know, have their voice be heard at that meeting.”</p><p> The Hancock administration has set aside $1.7 million for participatory budgeting, or “PB,” as government types call it. After years of pushing from City Councilwomen Robin Kniech and Candi CdeBaca and other activists, Denverites will get to decide how to spend that cash during a public process next year."</p><p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dnvrite/">Denverite</a></p><a href="https://denverite.com/2020/12/01/denverites-are-getting-a-1-7-million-allowance/"><img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQAN1Yjusz7JSfQ1&w=600&h=600&url=https%3A%2F%2Fi2.wp.com%2Fwp-denverite.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F4%2F2020%2F12%2F201125-EAST-COLFAX-AVENUE-WHAT-WOULD-YOU-DO-WITH-A-MILLION-DOLLARS-PARTICIPATORY-BUDGETING-KEVINJBEATY-04.jpg%3Fresize%3D1200%252C630%26ssl%3D1&cfs=1&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQCCvMnhIHh2Dp0c" alt="" />Denverites are getting a $1.7 million allowanceThe city’s foray into “participatory budgeting” comes with caveats and criticism.
