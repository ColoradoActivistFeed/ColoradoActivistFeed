Leslie Herod, the first LGBTQ Black person elected in Colorado, called in to give the keynote address at City Hall. She said Martin Luther King Jr. Day is a time to reflect on King’s legacy and remember what he fought for and continue that work. Referencing the recent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, Herod said now is a time when people need to come together.</p><p> “We are at a breaking point in our country’s history,” Herod said. “We’re at a point in our country’s history where we will all be judged for how we stand up, not only as citizens and Americans and Coloradans but how we stand up as people, as humans and look out for each other.”<br /> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thedailysentinelgj/">The Daily Sentinel of Grand Junction</a></p><a href="https://www.gjsentinel.com/news/western_colorado/grand-junction-residents-gather-on-martin-luther-king-jr-day/article_6de89376-59ea-11eb-b7e1-bf1c5d02d3c4.html">Local leaders gathered and spoke at the annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration Monday in downtown Grand Junction.<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQFN7v9rKj_b3sOp&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com%2Fgjsentinel.com%2Fcontent%2Ftncms%2Fassets%2Fv3%2Feditorial%2Fa%2F87%2Fa8719e86-59ed-11eb-a72c-b77a32d9705b%2F6006285b4f1d2.image.jpg%3Fresize%3D946%252C630&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQGS-K3w8lAjJeub" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>gjsentinel.com</p><p>Grand Junction residents gather on Martin Luther King Jr. Day</p>Local leaders gathered and spoke at the annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration Monday in downtown Grand Junction.<a href="https://www.gjsentinel.com/news/western_colorado/grand-junction-residents-gather-on-martin-luther-king-jr-day/article_6de89376-59ea-11eb-b7e1-bf1c5d02d3c4.html">Local leaders gathered and spoke at the annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration Monday in downtown Grand Junction.</a>]]></content:encoded>
