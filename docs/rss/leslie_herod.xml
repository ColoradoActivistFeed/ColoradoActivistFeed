Leslie Herod, the first LGBTQ Black person elected in Colorado, called in to give the keynote address at City Hall. She said Martin Luther King Jr. Day is a time to reflect on King’s legacy and remember what he fought for and continue that work.

Leslie Herod — the first LGBTQ African-American in Colorado’s General Assembly — was CU Boulder’s legislative council president in the early 2000’s. Herod said she, too, focused on policy changes that received backlash including around racial justice and LGBTQ issues. One thing I don’t think people realize is the exact weight of it all,” Herod said, noting that CU Boulder student government is the most autonomous in the nation, responsible for allocating tens of millions of dollars in student fees. “I can’t understate the impact that experience had on me and my now colleagues who are continuing their work for change through being elected officials, policy making and community leadership.” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverpost/">The Denver Post</a></p><a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2021/01/11/isaiah-chavous-cu-boulder-student-body-president/">As a young boy, Isaiah Chavous hid under his mom’s desk during her college days at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs, playing with green army men and chomping snacks while she compl…<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQEm6iML5bG28wWl&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.denverpost.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F12%2FTDP-L-CHAVOUS_436.jpg%3Fw%3D1024%26h%3D705&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQHeV-aQpfdXO9Xr" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>denverpost.com</p><p>Isaiah Chavous hid under his mom’s college desk as a baby.
