I love cooking for days, eating for days and sharing love, laughs and thanks with my family and friends. </p><p> 2020 has been a tough year. Many of us would give anything to be with our families today. To hug a loved one, to laugh with our cousins over a game of spades, to learn a new recipe from a beloved elder. But this year is different. It has to be.</p>...<p> The pandemic is raging through Colorado. One in 41 people are contagious with COVID right now.</p><p> So today, I'm staying put in Denver with my puppy, Clinton. I am missing precious family time to keep family members safe and to help our hospitals stay under capacity. </p><p> But still, there is much to be thankful for. First, I am thankful for all of you who are making this same sacrifice. </p><p> I also give thanks to:</p><p>  - The healthcare professionals who are risking their lives to save lives everyday. </p><p>  - The grocery store workers who are providing us with our daily essentials.</p><p>  - The delivery drivers who make it much easier for us to stay home.</p><p>  - The teachers and childcare providers who care for our children.</p><p>  - The business owners and employees who are trying to make things work in these uncertain times. </p><p> I am also thinking of the many of you who are mourning the loss of a loved one. My heart is with you.</p><p> No matter the struggles, we are in this together.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LeslieforColorado/posts/3700822326635974">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/LeslieforColorado/photos/a.864402556944646/3700822273302646/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/127141901_3700822276635979_6172006633559341952_o.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=2&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=TFQDLmVUCeQAX9i2ayy&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=64609a43eefb64472d2466b68aa48ede&oe=5FE762D0" alt="Image may contain: 1 person, dog, tree, outdoor and nature" width="500" height="667" caption="Image may contain: 1 person, dog, tree, outdoor and nature" /></a>]]></content:encoded>
