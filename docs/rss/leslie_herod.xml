I love cooking for days, eating for days and sharing love, laughs and thanks with my family and friends. </p><p> 2020 has been a tough year. Many of us would give anything to be with our families today. To hug a loved one, to laugh with our cousins over a game of spades, to learn a new recipe from a beloved elder. But this year is different. It has to be.</p>...<p> The pandemic is raging through Colorado. One in 41 people are contagious with COVID right now.</p><p> So today, I'm staying put in Denver with my puppy, Clinton. I am missing precious family time to keep family members safe and to help our hospitals stay under capacity. </p><p> But still, there is much to be thankful for. First, I am thankful for all of you who are making this same sacrifice. </p><p> I also give thanks to:</p><p>  - The healthcare professionals who are risking their lives to save lives everyday. </p><p>  - The grocery store workers who are providing us with our daily essentials.</p><p>  - The delivery drivers who make it much easier for us to stay home.</p><p>  - The teachers and childcare providers who care for our children.</p><p>  - The business owners and employees who are trying to make things work in these uncertain times. </p><p> I am also thinking of the many of you who are mourning the loss of a loved one.
