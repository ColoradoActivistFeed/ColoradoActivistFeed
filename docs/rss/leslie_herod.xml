I remember back in 2013, when a woman drove past the barricade — a Black woman — was shot and killed,” Herod said.</p><p> She said that even if the police were not in fact colluding with the mobs, they at least weren’t as prepared as they were during the BLM protests over the summer, indicating to her ...that they did not take the insurrectionists as seriously as a threat as they did people of color chanting for justice.</p><p> There is an obvious explanation for that disparity, she said.</p><p> “What I’ve learned in my life is that the obvious answer is probably the right one,” Herod said. “And the obvious is that it is white supremacy, it is racism, and it is discrimination, that allows those people to storm the Capitol to make it to the Senate floor, to make it into Speaker Pelosi’s office, mostly unscathed and free.”</p><p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dnvrite/">Denverite</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LeslieforColorado/posts/3810188509032688">See More</a><a href="https://denverite.com/2021/01/07/for-denver-activists-and-lawmakers-police-response-to-attack-on-u-s-capitol-highlights-disparity-in-treatment-of-black-and-brown-protestors/">Activists say that the Capitol police’s seemingly lax treatment of insurrectionists reflects racial dynamics that exist here in Denver.<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQEqE2AnMe0AQ6pm&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp-denverite.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F4%2F2020%2F05%2F200529-PROTEST-RALLY-BLACK-LIVES-MATTER-GEORGE-FLOYD-KEVINJBEATY-53-1200x630.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQHQjDoH5-GCFZjX" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>denverite.com</p><p>For Denver activists and lawmakers, police response to attack on U.S. Capitol highlights disparity in treatment of Black and brown protestors</p>Activists say that the Capitol police’s seemingly lax treatment of insurrectionists reflects racial dynamics that exist here in Denver.<a href="https://denverite.com/2021/01/07/for-denver-activists-and-lawmakers-police-response-to-attack-on-u-s-capitol-highlights-disparity-in-treatment-of-black-and-brown-protestors/">Activists say that the Capitol police’s seemingly lax treatment of insurrectionists reflects racial dynamics that exist here in Denver.</a>]]></content:encoded>
