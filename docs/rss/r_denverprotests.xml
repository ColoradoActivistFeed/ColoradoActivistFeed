      <title>Refusing to vote IS a form of protest</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If voting really mattered, even at the local level, then why is there still a pitbull ban in Denver? Voting is a joke, they allow it so people can falsely feel as if they have a voice that&#39;s helping shape our communities. In reality, your vote doesn&#39;t matter. A corporation or a lobby group gets much more say than you or I. The only way we will fix our country is by ignoring the rules and structures they have in place and start to replace them with our own. Elections included.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Frrrrtttttttttttt"> /u/Frrrrtttttttttttt </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/jbckrg/refusing_to_vote_is_a_form_of_protest/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/jbckrg/refusing_to_vote_is_a_form_of_protest/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>CoViD in schools and I don&#39;t know how to help.</title>

      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If mods think this is off-topic, please delete and suggest a different sub. Maybe this is just <a href="/r/offmychest">r/offmychest</a> material.</p> <p>First some background.</p> <p>My mother is an elementary school teacher, in her 60&#39;s with multiple underlying conditions. She&#39;s very liberal and usually incredibly nice and helpful. I had to move back in with her due to CoViD and how that made my financial situation untenable. She&#39;s been doing online schooling since April. Now, they&#39;re doing a slow roll on reopening the school, 1 or 2 grades at a time. They&#39;ve implemented a lot of security theater, but done very little to actually prevent spread.</p> <p>There are now confirmed CoViD cases in the school and all they&#39;ve done is send emails to parents saying everything is fine. Then they quarantined that class, even though the kids from all classes play together at recess. It has likely already spread.</p> <p>Now my mom&#39;s grade goes back next week, and I don&#39;t want her to die. Or have long lasting after effects. Or have my sister get it. Or me.</p> <p>For months, me and my little sister have been trying to get her to organize with her fellow teachers in order to better protect themselves from the bureaucratic bull that their admin imposes on them. She sees and agrees that she will likely get it from one of her kids, but refuses to even hear us out; to organize or do anything to improve the situation.</p> <p>This was some rant, but it&#39;s denver local and I&#39;d like some advice from locals who organize.</p> <p>So, I have 3 questions:</p> <p>Is there any way I can get through to her?</p> <p>Is there anything I can do from the outside to try to improve the situation, to do the organizing for her, or make a picket, or something?</p> <p>Do I just resign myself to getting CoViD eventually and watching my family get sick too?</p> <p>Edit: I learned more and removed unnecessarily harsh language.</p> <p>update 1: She came back from a staff meeting today, very pissed. They&#39;ve changed the rules so she can&#39;t ask for an exemption. They changed the rules from 13 kids per class to up to 31 per class. She talked to her union rep at the school, who has been calling the union constantly, no help. Usually she doesn&#39;t even get a call back.</p> <p>Now that she&#39;s convinced that the admin won&#39;t help, the district won&#39;t help, the union won&#39;t help. She&#39;s exhausted every legitimate avenue available. She finally broke and agreed it&#39;s time to play hardball.</p> <p>We&#39;re gonna call the health departments and get them to launch an investigation. She&#39;ll be taking videos and pictures to show proof of packed classrooms and that kids aren&#39;t being social distanced. Once we got evidence, we&#39;ll be contacting local papers to put the district on blast. The parents are being kept out of the loop, and she&#39;s gonna work with her in union rep to try to get the parents riled up. If this continues to escalate, I&#39;ll come back here and ask for bodies to help us protest this shit. See you in the streets friends.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Berathor113"> /u/Berathor113 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ja6asr/covid_in_schools_and_i_dont_know_how_to_help/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ja6asr/covid_in_schools_and_i_dont_know_how_to_help/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Statement on Saturday&#39;s Counter Protest</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/j9xr9z/statement_on_saturdays_counter_protest/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>On Saturday, October 10th, the Denver Communists, W.I.T.C.H. Denver, the Front Range Mutual Aid Network, Colorado Socialist Revolution, and others held a rally to oppose and confront a fascist militia gathering. Canned and dry foods were collected and hot meals were cooked and served. We also set up tables under canopies to facilitate political conversation, distribute Marxist literature, and invite the people we meet to organize with us to grow the anti-racist, anti-fascist movement. By midafternoon all of our goals had been accomplished--most importantly our counter protest had outnumbered, drowned out, and driven off the fascist rally. </p> <p>As the ‘patriots’ shuffled off in defeat, a little over an hour after their assembly began, one of them struck, maced, and was subsequently shot and killed by another person. The best information we have is that the shooter was a Pinkerton security contractor employed by 9News, the local NBC affiliate. It has also come out that the person who was killed had violently attacked a Black Lives Matter protestor last summer and was aggressively confronting a Black man moments before the shooting. While we support the right to self-defense and encourage emancipatory collective self-defense independent of the capitalist state by the working class and the oppressed, we believe that our best defense is built with mass organization, not by individual acts of violence. Throughout the history of fascist and far-right organizing, mass movements of oppressed working class people mobilized to oppose them. This has proven to be the most effective, unequivocal and powerful solution. </p> <p>Our experience on Saturday bears this out. Without firing a shot, or even connecting with a soup can, we were able to effectively repel the gathering of III%ers, Oath Keepers, Proud Boys, and other white nationalists, while building closer contacts with other workers looking to organize against racism, fascism, and capitalism more broadly. Some media outlets reporting on the event, including the one who employed the alleged shooter, imply that the Denver Communists and others involved in opposing the far-right gathering were responsible for the shooting. This isn’t just incorrect, it inverts the situation entirely--had they been able to assemble without our opposition, the militia-fascists would have felt more empowered to exercise violence, not less. </p> <p>The police don’t do anything to stand against fascist violence-- not on Saturday nor this entire summer of mass uprising, not to speak of the historical camaraderie between cops and fascists. We’ve seen them work hand-in-hand with the armed right wing in Kenosha, Portland, and Minneapolis. It’s no different here in Denver where even when the police aren’t directly coordinating with militias and white-nationalist groups they’re always ready to defend them. On Saturday, while we fed the hungry with soup and communist politics, it was no coincidence that the police were facing our rally and kept their backs turned to the armed vigilantes behind them. We can’t rely on the state to oppose reactionary politics. Instead we seek to organize masses of workers to protect ourselves, our communities, and each other.</p> <p>If we recognize that our power to combat fascism comes from masses organized against it, that also means that our orientation needs to be to the public. While we acknowledge the importance of security and safeguarding those involved in organizing with us, we believe that many have mistaken obscurity with security. Instead, the Denver Communists are committed to organizing publicly, openly, and confidently. We don’t see any other way to grow the large, combative social movements that are necessary to fight the increasingly deadly status quo. After the success of the BLM-Antifa Soup Drive, we look forward to confronting the far right again the next time they rear their ugly heads. We encourage anyone interested in getting involved to attend our next meeting, over Zoom this Wednesday, where we’ll discuss our approach to organizing against the far right.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/denversocialists"> /u/denversocialists </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/j9xr9z/statement_on_saturdays_counter_protest/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/j9xr9z/statement_on_saturdays_counter_protest/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

Due to the lack of a stimulus package negotiation, millions of Americans aren&#39;t only suffering from Covid; they are suffering from poverty. What Harris said is the middle finger to all who are essential workers. They would let us die like good boys and girls, just for them to virtue signal our causes. While poverty has exploded, these politicians can eat brunch in their mansions.
