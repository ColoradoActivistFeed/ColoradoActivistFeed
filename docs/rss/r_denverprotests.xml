A documentary called Shadowgate warned us about the possibility </p> <p>I understand how HAMMER SCORECARD works its an extremely common hacking technique called a man and the middle attack.

      <title>Parler: Conservatives Can&#39;t Computer</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/kvbyjk/parler_conservatives_cant_computer/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Not 1TB, Not 2TB, Not 3TB but 80TB.</p> <p>Before AWS stopped hosting Parler last night, security researchers did a little bit of archiving. How much archiving? 70TB of posts, videos, and evidence were all archived. It gets better. For a confidential amount of time, by manipulating the phone and email verification, it was possible to create Parler accounts in Parler&#39;s system, *wait for it*, ADMIN USERS. Basically, these accounts were used to take big fat data dumps from Parler information, in a sense creating a &#39;Parler Tracker&#39;</p> <p>Now because these are admin accounts not only it has video and image data but also has that good EXIF data, a.k.a metadata. Metadata including times, dates, and locations. Parler earlier this year made it clear, that it never technically deleted posts, instead it removed the pointer mechanism to that post, meaning that the admin accounts had access to ALL DELETED POSTS. Then it gets spicer to USER INFORMATION. See folks, the &#39;Parler Verification System&#39;, you would need to take a photo of your government-issued ID. Other information that will come in handy is IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses, email addresses, passwords, phone numbers, even going as far as providing metadata to the geographical location.</p> <p>Short story short: Conservatives can&#39;t computer. Prepare for conservative public freakouts. </p> <p>Here&#39;s the article if you&#39;d like to read more: <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/social-networking/news/80tb-parler-posts-photos-videos-leaked-by-security-researchers-law-enforcement-can-use-to-identify-january-6-attackers-2350920">https://gadgets.ndtv.com/social-networking/news/80tb-parler-posts-photos-videos-leaked-by-security-researchers-law-enforcement-can-use-to-identify-january-6-attackers-2350920</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/your_local_manager"> /u/your_local_manager </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/kvbyjk/parler_conservatives_cant_computer/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/kvbyjk/parler_conservatives_cant_computer/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>A Reflection of the Coup (tw: death)</title>

      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What happened at the US capitol was an attempted fascist coup because Trump has constantly incited violence. I have known peoples parents who went to that and got hurt. So far the death count is still ticking upward from that event because not only because of physical damage but mental damage. </p> <p>Rosanne Boyland, 34, GA - she was trampled to death while she was carrying the ‘Don’t Tread on Me’ flag. She became a hardcore conspiracy theorist.</p> <p>Benjamin Phillips, 50, PA - he died from a stroke; where EMT could not get to him because protesters. He apparently made a Trump website called ‘Trumparoo’ which helped organize buses to Trump rallies. </p> <p>Kevin Greeson, 55, AL - he died from a heart attack which was triggered from him tasering his own testicles. </p> <p>One of the most common themes is that these people were radicalized by Facebook groups, conspiracy sites, and Q anon. Some of these people aren’t fighters, some of them are old enough to be your parents. If this shows us anything it’s to show empathy towards individuals who have radical family members. </p> <p>Several high profile streamers who were positive for COVID, went there further more infecting people. The people who are coming back in the next week from DC are now finding out that they had lost their jobs and are deemed a security risk to the US government. These people are running out of options and will likely cause more violent attacks from this demographic. </p> <p>If anything, make sure everyone in your inner circle is safe from conservative conspiracy theories. Make sure that you talk to them, so that they don’t feel so isolated that the need to subscribe to detrimental ideas. </p> <p>Remember, Fuck around and find out.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/your_local_manager"> /u/your_local_manager </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/kuppop/a_reflection_of_the_coup_tw_death/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/kuppop/a_reflection_of_the_coup_tw_death/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone, TaroPeril here. You&#39;ve probably noticed that the number of weekly events have been dwindling for a while. I&#39;ve been scouring as many places as I can think of, but it seems that active protests have gone into hibernation for a little while, so I&#39;m going to keep this single pinned thread up for the next several weeks, and maybe months. We&#39;ll see where we are in the new year. I&#39;ll still be around, and if I see any new and notable events scheduled, I&#39;ll put it here. You&#39;re always welcome to DM me with any you find, too!</p> <p>Please see our <a href="https://mailfence.com/pub/cal/denverprotestsdaily?a=1">new calendar</a> for the most complete list of upcoming vetted events.</p> <p>Events are color coded as follows:</p> <ul> <li>red: rally/protest/march</li> <li>purple: campaign (an event allowing activity spanning across several days)</li> <li>blue: government meeting</li> <li>yellow: education/training</li> <li>green: news</li> <li>orange: panel</li> <li>black: vigil</li> <li>pink: mutual aid</li> </ul> <h1>Wiki</h1> <p>To avoid repeating too much information from day to day, we&#39;ve created the beginnings of a wiki <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/wiki/index">here</a>. Your feedback is much needed, as this is my (TaroPeril&#39;s) first experience with a reddit wiki. It contains links to livestreamers, your rights as a protestor, and more.</p> <h1>Notable Events</h1> <h3>December 12</h3> <p><strong>12:00 pm - 2:00 pm</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/__ovas__/status/1337062239984115712/photo/1">Call to Action!</a> (Twitter post)</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> Community-organized</p> <p><em>Location:</em> Colorado State Capitol</p> <p><em>Host-provided information:</em> Denver!

Community leaders will be demonstrating how to make survival items for the unhoused while I curse about how unnecessary this should be and demand that City Council press Hancock for #SolutionsNotSweeps in the 2021 budget, the first step to #defundthepolice and reallocate precious dollars to be invested in community SOLUTIONS. </p> <p><em>Type of Event:</em> Rally/March</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p><strong>5:30 PM</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/melanatedmic">Melanated Mic Night</a> (Twitter post)</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> Community-organized</p> <p><em>Location:</em> Online while it&#39;s cold outside.
