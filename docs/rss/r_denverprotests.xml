Its a &quot;holiday&quot; Friday marks Day 100 of the start of these protest nationwide. I feel like we should be in the streets en masse this weekend. So I am coming here first to get feedback on the idea. Would you guys come out for this if i made the push to get numbers in the streets? Are there other groups that would help me run this event, this is an important one. I can get a few medics and probably 8-12 friends to marshall myself, Need supplies as well water of course snacks and such, i cant fund that alone and i certainly dont want people dehydrating out there. PSL Denver Communist Tay Anderson, other similar groups and figures that could help promote this and run various logistics. Speakers, the people kind and the sound the equipment kind both , generator or other power source. </p> <p>Just reaching out to see who is interested this is not an official event event yet just an idea. So lets not blast this all over the place and leave the organization end in the air and have a bunch of people out there confused.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to come in here and tell people what they should and should not be saying to cops. And I&#39;m all for demoralizing the shit out of them. But as someone with mental health challenges, it&#39;s VERY triggering to me when people yell at cops to kill themselves. Am I the only one? I feel like a lot of my fellow comrades struggle with their mental health as well, and that&#39;s only going to get worse as the battle continues. In the same vein as yelling homophobic and transphobic slurs at the police hurts our LGBTQ comrades, yelling at cops to kill themselves can be very ableist and hurtful to neurodivergent folks. Can we stick to telling them to quit their jobs? Does anyone else have any thoughts on this?</p> <p>Going along with this, I think we can&#39;t fall into the idea of death and violence solving our problems. It will make people pay attention, but it won&#39;t solve the problems of society. If we&#39;re really invested in police and prison abolition, we should be looking towards a future where people are taken care of and hence there is less avoidable death and violence. We all know that we&#39;re going to war and that people are going to die in said war, but we shouldn&#39;t WANT a war. I think war is inevitable at this point and that really hurts my heart because there will be a lot of casualties. </p> <p>I don&#39;t really know how to conclude these thoughts. Just deep in my feelings and want to find a way talk about this with the community.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/antitruncher"> /u/antitruncher </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ik3xls/dont_want_to_protest_police_but_tw_suicide/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ik3xls/dont_want_to_protest_police_but_tw_suicide/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

Every elected Denver official except Leslie Herod and Tay Anderson has remained silent on the issue of members of the 3% militia openly carrying firearms, along with knives and other weapons in the City of Denver, while they were all quick to condemn protestors over the breaking of a few windows.</p> <h1>Notable Events</h1> <h3>August 31</h3> <p><strong>7:00 am - 5:00 pm</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/bouldersafe/status/1300271665239265281">Stop the Sweeps!</a> (Twitter post)</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> Community-organized</p> <p><em>Location:</em> Boulder Central Park (near bandshell)</p> <p><em>Host-provided information:</em> CALL TO ACTION: An eviction notice for 8 am tomorrow has been posted for people living at Boulder Central Park near the bandshell.

(Supervised Use Sites <em>cough cough</em>) International Overdose Awareness Day acknowledges the grief felt by families and friends whose loved-ones have died or suffered permanent injury from a drug overdose. <a href="https://www.overdoseday.com/about-us/">https://www.overdoseday.com/about-us/</a> Swing by between 2pm and 4pm at our new facility (8th and Lincoln!!) to remember those we&#39;ve lost and fight like hell for those still with us. We will be socially distant this year, no march &amp; masks will be required. That said, we want to be with you, mourn with you, fight with you (outside and at a safe distance, of course). Folks are welcome to add your loved ones name/ a framed photo to our memorial wall. We will have signs for ruckus raising, info on Narcan &amp; fentanyl test strips, along with take away vigil materials.</p> <p><em>Type of Event:</em> Vigil</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p><strong>6:30 PM - 9:00 PM</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/melanatedmic/status/1299103836263514112">Melanated Mic Night</a> (Twitter post)</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> Community-organized</p> <p><em>Location:</em> Montbello Central Park (14255 Andrews Dr, Denver, CO 80239)</p> <p><em>Host-provided information:</em> Melanated mic night gives a voice for this melanated table.

Many of the residents of the encampment at 25th and Arapahoe have been living there for over 5 month. They have never got a bad mark when health inspectors have come by. The camp is clean and well managed. We in DHOL pay for a port-a-potty at the camp and together with MAD maintain the handwashing station. Most residents are on housing waitlists or otherwise actively seeking housing - to no avail. Yet, regardless the City is planning to sweep this group of about 50 people to nowhere on Tuesday. Some of the newer residents of this camp are here after moving from the sweeps at 22nd last week. They will be moved again with no solution as to where to go. If you want to come support the residents of this camp please do. The voice of residents who are facing this trauma need to be heard. Be there to listen and stand in solidarity with those living on these blocks. &quot;</p> <p><em>Type of Event:</em> Mutual Aid</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p><strong>12:00 PM - 1:00 PM</strong> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1568667129959924">RALLY: Don‚Äôt Starve, Fight!

In a typical American city, policing alone can account for 20% to 45% or higher of the entire discretionary budget. Those are investments that could be shifted to things that actually make our communities safer. Things like housing, health care, mental health services, safe living wage employment, education, youth programming, and income support to stay safe during the pandemic.

They see themselves as judge, jury, and executioner with total impunity. We still have not seen justice for Elijah McClain, Paul Castaway, Breonna Taylor, Tamir Rice, Alton Sterling, Philando Castile, Mike Brown, Daniel Shaver, Eric Garner, John Crawford &amp; so many many more names before and after the murder of George Floyd this May. A murder that sparked that nationwide protest that will reach Day 100 this Friday Sept 4th. Since George‚Äôs heinous murder we have seen an increase of police aggression like never before, and even more embolden murders by those who stand firmly behind a thin blue line. Our voice have seem to go unheard over this summer, therefore let us make them loud and clear. Let us fill the streets with numbers that dwarf the beginning of this movement for the 4 day weekend, starting on Day 100. This time lets make it clear. We want Freedom! We want Justice! This is a peaceful family friendly weekend of protest, however with both increasing police aggression on even the most peaceful of events coupled with far right wing agitation please bring what you need to keep you and your family safe. Come and leave in groups, and have a pre planned exit route. This should be standard practice for any type of event. Again though this is a peaceful event with the recent events that have occurred in Denver over the course of August, it is important that we show up and show that Denver can still be peaceful. A Peaceful weekend will also increase our numbers through out the 4 days This is a community sourced event that evolved out of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iks9gv/sept_47_laborday_weekend_not_much_going_on/">community discussion</a> on <a href="/r/denverprotest">/r/denverprotest</a> on reddit, therefore we need your help to make this a big event and a successful one.</p> <p><em>Type of Event:</em> Protest</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <h3>September 5</h3> <p><strong>4:00 PM - 7:00 PM</strong> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/627178161570963">Diol family memorial</a> (Facebook post)</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> Justice for Diol Family</p> <p><em>Location:</em> Colorado State Capitol</p> <p><em>Host-provided information:</em> Join us on September 5th, the 1 month memorial of the tragic murder of the Diol family.
