      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all! We&#39;ve gotten a lot of complaints recently about trolls and right wingers in our sub. So I wanted to ask you all, should be take a stricter stance and start removing them more proactively? If yes, how should a new rule be worded? I don&#39;t want this to be nothing more than an echo chamber, but I understand people&#39;s frustrations at having users derail conversations in threads. </p> <p>Would adding something like, &quot;While opposing viewpoints are fine, purposely derailing conversations, insulting our users, and general trolling are not allowed.&quot; be good for our community? Please let us know!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Bluedude588"> /u/Bluedude588 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iiv964/should_us_mods_be_more_proactive_in_banning_users/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iiv964/should_us_mods_be_more_proactive_in_banning_users/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Really earned their pinstripes as incels today. First they spent hours waiting around in parking lots and pacing down the street waiting for our numbers to dwindle. Then, after we had to breathe in toxic chemicals they walked right by us and acted like awkward middle schoolers at a dance where they were too afraid to approach us. They brought weapons to make them feel strong but their cowardly nature showed through when they hid behind DPD like a child hiding behind their parent.</p> <p>With leadership like Tig, I feel like we&#39;re in safe hands. He basically keeps them in line for us. He found all the Nazis in Denver and made sure they were always occupied and never got too close to us 😂</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Aegon_Targs_Uncle"> /u/Aegon_Targs_Uncle </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iio45f/imagine_meeting_up_with_john_tiegan_to_waste_6/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iio45f/imagine_meeting_up_with_john_tiegan_to_waste_6/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

I heard reports that others were kettled earlier. Residents on the street were gassed while standing on their lawns. Cops tried to intercept them before they could talk to journalists and make them go inside.</p> <p>11:03 - DPD has issued an order to disperse, and anyone who doesn&#39;t disperse is subject to arrest.</p> <p>11:11 - 3% militia has entered the scene. Cops position themselves between the militia and the protestors. Many of the militia are armed with knives.</p> <p>11:15 - DPD is <a href="https://twitter.com/garedicus/status/1299575639377424384?s=20">pushing protestors away from the precinct</a>. 3% is marching parallel to them. Off Meta Media is following the 3% militia.</p> <p>11:19 - Multiple reports of 3% militia <a href="https://twitter.com/KittyLists/status/1299576498358108160?s=20">openly carrying weapons</a>, despite open carry not being allowed in the city or County of Denver.

I&#39;ll post them if I find them.</p> <p>11:37 - A bit of a standoff happening here.</p> <p>12:00 - Everyone appears to have dispersed.

      <title>Thoughts on dealing with Proud Boiis</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iigndb/thoughts_on_dealing_with_proud_boiis/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Listen to <a href="https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-worst-year-ever-49377032/episode/the-weekend-of-so-many-different-70666328/">THIS</a> story of conflict-journalist turned nazi-puncher Robert Evans getting his hand broken by an anti-anti-fascist. He gives a great description of the kind of people that are showing up to counter-protest BLM. The proud boiis (originally a type-o but I’m gonna roll with it) and their white fragility/supremacy ilk are unquestionably dangerous, but not in the way they want to be. They’re trying to present themselves as serious, respectable people; a well-regulated militia of patriots who stand for law &amp; order with cool guns. They’re gonna fight SOCIALIST OPPRESSION and CANCEL CULTURE and the RADICAL LEFT in that <em>dashing</em> AR15/tac-vest combo. Tho, behind their expensive kit and <em>seriously very deadly</em> weaponry, these cosplaytriots are irrational, insecure, unpredictable people. </p> <p>Listening to Robert’s story, you get a sense the boiis could have panicked, opened fire into that crowd of hundreds, and gotten away in the chaos. The cops would let them go and probably high-five them on the way out. The president would say some inconsequential bullshit and they’d all get away with it. Kyle Rittenhouse was just the first. </p> <p>TLDR; tactics</p> <p>If our goal is keeping people safe* and unmurdered, we need to use purposeful de-escalation when encountering militant MAGA groups. Talk them down or ignore them like a loud baby brother. Stay tight at the shield wall and don’t let them rattle or move us. They&#39;ll want to escalate and provoke a violent response. Don’t give them any excuse to use their fancy toys. Throw balloons of pink, oil-based paint to distract and demoralize. Document everything in real time so you can try and hold them responsible later. The cops and feds can beat your ass and walk away, but these boiis don’t have legal immunity - yet.</p> <p>*If your plans do not include being safe, make sure everyone around is prepared, and have a plan.<br/> I&#39;m not trying to tell anyone how to protest, I&#39;m just offering some tactics. (Posting from an alt,) I’m a vet who’s been following the rise of American fascism. This is part of their plan: slowly ratchet up street violence and normalize a daily drumbeat of dead BLM/antifa. That way no one is surprised when they go full organized mass murder under the guise of self-defense. </p> <p>It’s only a matter of time before drunk bootlickers drop the pretense and just start shooting. If a situation escalates to gunfire, unfortunately my best advice is for everyone to hit the deck. Run, hide, or fight. Stay low and get behind something hard. Record or stream what&#39;s happening if you can.<br/> <del>Stay safe.</del> Be brave.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/iIIegaIstuff"> /u/iIIegaIstuff </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iigndb/thoughts_on_dealing_with_proud_boiis/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iigndb/thoughts_on_dealing_with_proud_boiis/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

Hear about conditions in Colorado&#39;s prisons and learn about the urgent need to reduce the number of people incarcerated during this public health emergency. A prison sentence should not be a death sentence, but that is precisely the fate that our panelists fear for their loved ones. Among others, hear from Amber Johnson, the daughter of Ronald Johnson. Mr. Johnson is a 62-year-old grandfather who relies on an inhaler to breathe. He has turned his life around in prison after being convicted of non-violent offenses related to substance abuse, but he is still years away from release. Panelists will also include attorneys involved in the lawsuit against the Colorado Department of Corrections and Governor Polis for their failure to protect our vulnerable, incarcerated neighbors from COVID-19.

Justice for Vanessa Guillen!</a> (Facebook Event)</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> Students for a Democratic Society-Denver, Denver Peace Council, Sanctuary4All Colorado, and others</p> <p><em>Location:</em> La Raza Park (1501 W. 38th Ave, Denver CO)</p> <p><em>Host-provided information:</em> On August 29, 1970 over 30,000 Chicanos and supporters from all over the U.S. united in East Los Angeles to protest against the high casualty rate of Chicanos in the Vietnam War. The protest also denounced the racist military draft, police brutality of Chicanos, as well as racism in general. LAPD and LASD brutally attacked the peaceful rally at Laguna Park, beating and tear gassing hundreds and arresting scores of people. The people fought back, and many police went down, as the rebellion continued on Whittier Boulevard in East LA. The police killed event attendees, Angel Diaz and Ruben Salazar. Ruben Salazar was a KMEX News Director and LA Times news reporter covering the historic event. Lynn Ward, a Brown Beret, also died during the demonstration. To commemorate the 50th anniversary of this momentous day, Centro CSO and other Chicano organizations in Los Angeles have called for a national day of action against racism, sexism, and fascism. Join us at the Colorado State Capitol on August 29th to join this national call and demand an end to police crimes and justice for Vanessa Guillen, a young Chicana whose murder is currently being covered by the US military. Guillen is just one example of many soldiers of color fooled into the dream of serving the country in order to be slain at the hands of the very people who were supposed to lead and serve. #ChicanoLiberationDay #ChicanoNationalDay #LegalizationForAll #JusticeForVanessaGuillen </p> <p><em>Type of Event:</em> Protest/Rally</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <h3>August 30</h3> <p><strong>10 AM - 12 PM</strong> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/s/denver-solidarity-ride/315130302977335">Denver Solidarity Ride</a> (Facebook event)</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> Denver Solidarity Ride, Black Girls Do Bike Denver, Major Taylor CC Denver, and others</p> <p><em>Location:</em> MLK Statue in City Park</p> <p><em>Host-provided information:</em> The Denver Solidarity Rides are hosted by a collective of cyclists in the Mile High City.

Our communities too have long suffered under the knee of the racist police and white supremacy. We are now entering the third month of uprising, and demonstrations continue with no sign of stopping, demanding justice for the victims of the police in our own community and an end to all forms of racist violence. The police and their racist backers are united in their determination to put down the powerful nationwide movement that is sending shudders through the entire racist system. On Saturday, July 25, a protest demanding justice for Elijah McClain, who was murdered in August 2019 by Aurora Police, was violently attacked by two white supremacists. Protesters had taken over the highway when a Jeep broke through the barricade of cars shielding the crowd to hit the protesters. Fortunately, a driver in a truck at the rear of the crowd swerved to intercept the Jeep and slowed it enough to give protesters moments to clear the road. The Jeep sped through the scrambling crowd at top speed and exited the highway, where it pulled up behind an Aurora Police car and was given assistance. The two white men from the Jeep were not arrested and when their severely damaged car was towed, they were given a ride in a police car without handcuffs. Aurora Police confirmed they made no arrests. This attack was nothing less than white supremacist terrorism intended to halt the advance of the anti-racist struggle. Just as white supremacy resisted the advance towards equality during Reconstruction and the Civil Rights movement, so it does today. It is critical that in these moments, we stand together as a community and demonstrate our commitment to carrying forward the struggle against racism. Please join the Party for Socialism and Liberation and the Frontline Party for Revolutionary Action on August 30 for a march bringing together Denver and Aurora to demonstrate our unity and determination in the fight against racism and police violence. <strong><em>Attendees are invited to march on foot or in their cars.</em></strong> We will begin our march at the Martin Luther King Jr. Library in Aurora and march down Colfax to end at the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial at City Park in Denver. </p> <p><em>Type of Event:</em> Protest</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/denverprotestsdaily"> /u/denverprotestsdaily </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ifj3cj/whats_happening_the_week_of_august_24_august_30/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ifj3cj/whats_happening_the_week_of_august_24_august_30/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>
