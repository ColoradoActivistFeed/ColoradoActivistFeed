Your feedback is much needed, as this is my (TaroPeril&#39;s) first experience with a reddit wiki. It contains links to livestreamers, your rights as a protestor, and more.</p> <h1>News</h1> <p>Denver PD was suspiciously friendly towards a right-wing group of 3% militia on Friday night after they lobbed so much tear gas at protestors that it completely reduced visibility on the street, and seeped into the homes of residents around the 6th Precinct. Every elected Denver official except Leslie Herod and Tay Anderson has remained silent on the issue of members of the 3% militia openly carrying firearms, along with knives and other weapons in the City of Denver, while they were all quick to condemn protestors over the breaking of a few windows.</p> <h1>Notable Events</h1> <h3>August 31</h3> <p><strong>7:00 am - 5:00 pm</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/bouldersafe/status/1300271665239265281">Stop the Sweeps!</a> (Twitter post)</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> Community-organized</p> <p><em>Location:</em> Boulder Central Park (near bandshell)</p> <p><em>Host-provided information:</em> CALL TO ACTION: An eviction notice for 8 am tomorrow has been posted for people living at Boulder Central Park near the bandshell.

Many of the residents of the encampment at 25th and Arapahoe have been living there for over 5 month. They have never got a bad mark when health inspectors have come by. The camp is clean and well managed. We in DHOL pay for a port-a-potty at the camp and together with MAD maintain the handwashing station. Most residents are on housing waitlists or otherwise actively seeking housing - to no avail. Yet, regardless the City is planning to sweep this group of about 50 people to nowhere on Tuesday. Some of the newer residents of this camp are here after moving from the sweeps at 22nd last week. They will be moved again with no solution as to where to go. If you want to come support the residents of this camp please do. The voice of residents who are facing this trauma need to be heard.

      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This is a follow up to a post last week, any advice would be appreciated.</p> <p>Last Sunday I attended a protest in Denver which was also attended by proud boys counterprotesting. It didn&#39;t take long for both sides to get in a shouting match with DPD in riot gear coming in seperating both sides. As this was happening in plain view of MULTIPLE officers and witnesses I was punched in the face by a Proud boy. Not a big surprise. What was surprising was the 5 officers who then tackled me to the ground while allowing my assailant to flee along with the rest of the PBs. </p> <p>I tried to get the officers to speak to with witnesses or look at the video which shows I never even raised my hands. The SGT. on duty laughed that off and I was charged with public fighting and not allowed to press charges. I spent the night in jail on what was described as outstanding warrants. That turned out to be false and the report of the night was suspiciously bare. I&#39;m currently seeking body cam footage and will update/post as soon as I can. </p> <p>I was told by the Sgt that &quot;it was good that I was being arrested, I had no reason to be out there&quot; I&#39;m sharing this because I want everyone to understand that as a brown man I do not regret a single moment of what occured, I will not be bullied by badges, titles, or militias. I love you all for everything you have been sacrificing for us, for one another. </p> <p><a href="https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=309879033574051&amp;id=904453342906421&amp;_rdr">https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=309879033574051&amp;id=904453342906421&amp;_rdr</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/voy23"> /u/voy23 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ij5pgk/denver_police_allow_proud_boy_to_assasult/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ij5pgk/denver_police_allow_proud_boy_to_assasult/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hear me out, I know that sounded like some liberal nonsense.</p> <p>So last night DPD broke out the gas fast and heavy, without any warning. Most of Washington street outside the 6th precinct was covered at one point, with lingering effects for hours. </p> <p>Obviously DPD doesn&#39;t care about us that much, but they inadvertently gassed tons of local residents who were relaxing outside on their property, and even inside enjoying the cooler temperatures through open windows. One woman told me her baby had gotten hit with the gas coming in through an open window.</p> <p>I spoke to many of the residents and at least 20 of them said they&#39;d be willing to call in and write emails to DPD and their elected officials demanding an end to gas on their street, especially if provided with a form letter or script. It&#39;s a wealthier (and let&#39;s be honest, whiter) neighborhood, and they actually do dump money into the local area. They definitely have more pull with the police and their elected leaders than we do.</p> <p>If we could successfully do that there, it could lead to more neighborhoods and areas where residents are tired of being constantly gassed while simply existing in their homes doing the same, and limiting DPD&#39;s use of gas.</p> <p>Issue is, I don&#39;t know where to even begin to organize that. Do we have any DSA or PSL reps in this sub who might be able to get the ball rolling with some kind of door-to-door campaign on those streets? I feel like have an actual organization with a face behind it would help encourage residents to follow through.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HolidayInn-Cambodia"> /u/HolidayInn-Cambodia </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iix642/emailletter_campaign/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iix642/emailletter_campaign/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

I don&#39;t want this to be nothing more than an echo chamber, but I understand people&#39;s frustrations at having users derail conversations in threads. </p> <p>Would adding something like, &quot;While opposing viewpoints are fine, purposely derailing conversations, insulting our users, and general trolling are not allowed.&quot; be good for our community? Please let us know!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Bluedude588"> /u/Bluedude588 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iiv964/should_us_mods_be_more_proactive_in_banning_users/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iiv964/should_us_mods_be_more_proactive_in_banning_users/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/OMindependent/videos/741420016436680">Off Meta Media stream</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/fatalmeltdwn?sr=a">Fatalmltdwn Twitch stream</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddvzcmajIRI">Cut the Plastic livestream</a></p> <p>10:55 PM - Protestors have been gassed twice now, and are currently pushed onto Colfax. I heard reports that others were kettled earlier. Residents on the street were gassed while standing on their lawns. Cops tried to intercept them before they could talk to journalists and make them go inside.</p> <p>11:03 - DPD has issued an order to disperse, and anyone who doesn&#39;t disperse is subject to arrest.</p> <p>11:11 - 3% militia has entered the scene. Cops position themselves between the militia and the protestors. Many of the militia are armed with knives.</p> <p>11:15 - DPD is <a href="https://twitter.com/garedicus/status/1299575639377424384?s=20">pushing protestors away from the precinct</a>. 3% is marching parallel to them. Off Meta Media is following the 3% militia.</p> <p>11:19 - Multiple reports of 3% militia <a href="https://twitter.com/KittyLists/status/1299576498358108160?s=20">openly carrying weapons</a>, despite open carry not being allowed in the city or County of Denver. Police are being so chill with the militia, as expected.</p> <p>11:23 - I hear that videos exist that show the DPD openly colluding with the 3% militia. I&#39;ll post them if I find them.</p> <p>11:37 - A bit of a standoff happening here.</p> <p>12:00 - Everyone appears to have dispersed. Hope everyone has gotten home safely!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TaroPeril"> /u/TaroPeril </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iimaol/its_going_down_in_front_of_the_6th_precinct_right/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iimaol/its_going_down_in_front_of_the_6th_precinct_right/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>
