      <title>Question about Melanated Mic Night (sept 21)</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey <a href="/r/Denverprotests">r/Denverprotests</a>, </p> <p>I&#39;m a white high school teacher, and some of my students are interested in attending Melanated Mic Night tomorrow. Right now, the only kids interested identify as POCs, but I could imagine that some of my white students may end up wanting to attend tomorrow, too. I haven&#39;t been out for this event yet, so I&#39;m hoping those of you familiar with the event can give me some guidance (cannot seem to DM Melanated Mic organizers on twitter).</p> <p>Is this a BIPOC-only space? Would it be appropriate 1) for me to attend and 2) to potentially bring white students with me? I will be clear with my students who are not POCs that we are there to listen, learn, witness, amplify BIPOC voices, and stand in solidarity, *NOT* to get airtime on the mic. All students I might bring are involved in supporting BLM; I absolutely will not bring any students who would be disruptive. If this is community event by and for BIPOC folks and white allies are better off showing up to something else, though, that&#39;s cool - definitely don&#39;t want to insert myself &amp; my students inappropriately!</p> <p>Any advice? Thanks so much for your help!!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/living_foggy"> /u/living_foggy </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iwmmg2/question_about_melanated_mic_night_sept_21/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iwmmg2/question_about_melanated_mic_night_sept_21/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Colorado has one of only about 5 senators who could make a difference in the coming Supreme Court nomination. While our letters will almost certainly be ignored, I feel it’s important to reinforce to Senator Gardner that a vote for this nomination will not be the will of his constituents. A single letter may not be substantial but a flood of them certainly could make him at least consider the will of the constituents.</p> <p>This is a highly contested election for him and he may care about your vote more than you realize.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TipsyPeanuts"> /u/TipsyPeanuts </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iwf3i2/write_a_letter_to_cory_gardners_office_about_the/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iwf3i2/write_a_letter_to_cory_gardners_office_about_the/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

Nice to meet you!</p> <p>Sorry for the new throwaway account, secret identity and all that…</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>I am hoping to gather with like-minded comrades this Saturday at the PSL support rally, so that we can make some fucking noise and let these assholes know who owns the streets. All are welcome.</p> <p>Sound like your kind of fun? Join Denver’s <strong>ACAB Bucket Brigade</strong> in letting the racist murdering APD and DPD know that their repressive fascist bullshit will not stand. </p> <p>Loud and powerful drum lines empower our comrades, help to sustain high protest energy and magnify our chants. It can also be damn intimidating for our enemies. Time to bring the noise! </p> <p><strong>Here’s a guide to protest drumming:</strong> </p> <p><a href="http://puppetista.org/drums/index.html">http://puppetista.org/drums/index.html</a></p> <p>All one needs is a plastic bucket and a drumstick or two (wooden spoons work, but real drumsticks are the best).</p> <p><strong>Here are some links to DIY plans for a drum using only a bucket and some duct tape.</strong></p> <p><a href="https://youtu.be/PTKuI2dm7kk">https://youtu.be/PTKuI2dm7kk</a></p> <p><a href="http://puppetista.org/drums/bucketdrums.html">http://puppetista.org/drums/bucketdrums.html</a></p> <p>If you have extra time and resources, you can upgrade a 5 gallon bucket with two eye-bolts, 4 x nuts (double up to keep them secure) and a bungee cord. This design is nice because it can be worn comfortably around the waist, and this setup has great mobility. </p> <p><strong>Call to action: Bring your drums and make some noise at the Sat protest.</strong></p> <p>&amp; If you want to crew up with other drummers and get in some practice, or if you have buckets and tape to donate, <strong><em>meet up at the big red chair sculpture (The Yearling) on the North Lawn of Central Library starting at 11 am</em></strong><strong>.</strong> Donations of buckets can be dropped off here too! </p> <p>No matter what you do, show up and get loud.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mxcaptnthrowaway"> /u/mxcaptnthrowaway </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ivcxns/these_drums_kill_fascists/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ivcxns/these_drums_kill_fascists/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>This is why the PSL always told people to go home as soon as their protests were over.</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When PSL was doing their protests regularly, people on here were constantly complaining that they were ending them too soon and not riding the momentum of the moment enough. Despite that, some of their organizers are now arrested and are facing decades in prison. They were trying their hardest to not have their members arrested, but fuck all that did I guess.</p> <p>EDIT: The point of this post is to help people understand in the future why organizers/organizations might not associate themselves with anything other than legal protesting. Some people back in the beginning of all this did not seem to understand why PSL was holding back. This is why, though unfortunately it didn&#39;t pan out for them.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Bluedude588"> /u/Bluedude588 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iv87rg/this_is_why_the_psl_always_told_people_to_go_home/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iv87rg/this_is_why_the_psl_always_told_people_to_go_home/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Peaceful protesters are facing huge prison sentences. People are being charged for defending themselves against white supremacist terrorists because the police are ideologically aligned. This is fascism.</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll address this to the cops reading, because they&#39;re the ones who obviously least understand what&#39;s happening here.</p> <p>People just wanted some better ways to be involved in the &#39;good&#39; side of law enforcement, instead of always feeling like your enemies. We just wanted some accountability for the bad apples who went too far, and for enforcement to be a bit more consistent and a bit less arbitrary.</p> <p>People protested non-violently, peacefully. No one tracked down cops to their homes and threw molotovs into your windows. No one went out and shot up cops in revenge for any of the stuff your bad apples did.</p> <p>People just wanted justice, and all they&#39;ve done is asked for it. When we think the system is unjust and it refuses to change, we can be loud and we can get in the way of things because it&#39;s important to us, but we don&#39;t go committing the types of massacres that have are all-too frequently perpetrated by right-wing extremists.</p> <p>It doesn&#39;t seem to matter what people do, you refuse to give even the smallest concessions. You protect your bad apples until all that&#39;s visible to the outside world is rot. You brutally attack people who non-violently ask for these small changes. You help extremists commit terror attacks.</p> <p>And now, you want to put peaceful protesters in prison. People have done nothing to hurt anyone, to whom the worst accusations you can make are that they walked and they spoke and you didn&#39;t like where they walked and what they said.</p> <p>What do you think is going to happen when people peacefully demanding justice know that they&#39;ll face life in prison for marching? What remains, for the people who think that this injustice cannot stand without doing something?</p> <p>Your intention, of course, was to make people afraid that if they protest, they will go to prison for life. Your idea was that people who fight for justice will stop fighting because they will not want to spend their lives in prison.</p> <p>I hope I&#39;m wrong, but the flip side to your imprisoning peaceful people for life is that some who were remaining peaceful may make the calculation that now all paths towards justice lead to prison anyway. Those options that were off the table before may not seem as extreme when the consequence is life in prison regardless... <em>if they get caught</em>.</p> <p>Because when weighing up options for getting justice now, the decision must be made between publicly protesting and facing the wrath of a fascistic legal system, or taking more covert action.</p> <p>I hope that this is just my own anxieties and that all the charges are dropped against people who have been non-violently asking for justice. After seeing the horrible LASD ambush the other day I know that <em>no one wants to live a world where anyone thinks that kind of violence is their only way to obtain justice</em>.</p> <p>JFK quote here.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ilivoVovili"> /u/ilivoVovili </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iv4zn7/peaceful_protesters_are_facing_huge_prison/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iv4zn7/peaceful_protesters_are_facing_huge_prison/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.boulderdsa.org/resources/documents/FilmThePolice.pdf">https://www.boulderdsa.org/resources/documents/FilmThePolice.pdf</a> (about a 3 minute read)</p> <p>This is a pdf put together by the Boulder Democratic Socialists of America. Some of the advice and laws listed are specific to Boulder but a lot of the information is applicable as Colorado State Law and Statutes. <strong>Info Includes:</strong> Colorado Revised Statutes; a refresher on your rights in this situation; what an officer can ask you if detained, and interacting with non-police persons who are filmed due to your filming of police activity.</p> <p><a href="https://www.hmichaelsteinberg.com/can-the-police-stop-the-public-recording-of-their-actions.html">https://www.hmichaelsteinberg.com/can-the-police-stop-the-public-recording-of-their-actions.html</a> (about a 3 minute read)</p> <p>This is great info written by a Denver Defense Attorney, applicable for Colorado, not specific to any city. <strong>Info Includes:</strong> Your First Amendment Right To Record The Actions Of The Police,&amp; A 2015 Colorado Law That Allows For A Private Civil Lawsuit Against Police Who Violate Your Right To Record</p> <p><strong>Two Main Points</strong> (although I strongly recommend reading these through if you have time)<strong>:</strong> </p> <ol> <li><em>Colorado Revised Statutes 16-3-311. Peace officer incident recordings</em> • “(1) A person has the right to lawfully record any incident involving a peace officer and to maintain custody and control of that recording and the device used to record the recording. A peace officer shall not seize a recording or recording device without consent, without a search warrant or subpoena, or without a lawful exception to the warrant requirement.” <sup>• An officer can request to “obtain from a person a device used to record an incident involving a peace officer in order to access the recording as possible evidence in an investigation.” Tell them “I do not consent or volunteer to you taking my camera.” • (e</sup> Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a peace officer has the authority to temporarily seize and maintain control over a device that was used to record an incident involving a peace officer for no longer than seventy-two hours to obtain a search warrant when exigent circumstances exist such that the peace officer believes it is necessary to save a life or when the peace officer has a reasonable, articulable, goodfaith belief that seizure of the device is necessary to prevent the destruction of the evidentiary recording while a warrant is obtained.)</li> <li>You must avoid &quot;interfering&quot; with the investigation/actions. It is a good idea to STATE that you are a reasonable distance away for your video&#39;s audience (whether it be the courts if your camera gets seized, or just for viewers on a livestream. Try to take away any ambiguity or room for interpretation. In Boulder, this means staying at least 8 feet away; I did NOT FIND ANY SPECIFIC DISTANCE FOR DENVER, so if the police say to move back, that might be precedence to say you are interfering.</li> </ol> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Alarmed_Chard_4568"> /u/Alarmed_Chard_4568 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iuy9pg/guidelines_on_filming_police_your_rights_your/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iuy9pg/guidelines_on_filming_police_your_rights_your/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

Your feedback is much needed, as this is my (TaroPeril&#39;s) first experience with a reddit wiki. It contains links to livestreamers, your rights as a protestor, and more.</p> <h1>News</h1> <p>DPD shot two men in the span of 72 hours last week - <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/09/11/denver-police-shooting-west-high-school-identified/">Antonio Blackbear, the cousin of Paul Castaway</a> on September 10 and then <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/09/12/denver-police-shooting-saturday-west-colfax/">one as-of-yet unnamed man</a> on September 12. Then, they broke up a memorial service for Antonio Blackbear on the night of Friday, September 11, and <a href="https://twitter.com/__ovas__/status/1304662954735030272?s=20">arrested several protestors</a>. </p> <p>The Denver City Council will also be voting on the collective bargaining proposal agreed upon by Mayor Hancock and DPD. This proposal guarantees a 2.77% raise for all of DPD, at a time when other city departments are being furloughed and otherwise having their budgets slashed. <a href="https://www.westword.com/news/denver-city-council-poised-to-reject-police-bargaining-agreement-11788153">Five councilmembers have so far stated publicly that they will vote against this proposal</a>, which was negotiated behind closed doors. Only two more councilmembers are needed for a majority. If they turn down this proposal, this will be the first time ever that such an agreement has been rejected by the City Council. Contact your rep today!</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://sentinelcolorado.com/news/metro/aurora-council-committee-axes-2-proposals-approves-another-targeting-military-devices-tear-gas/">Aurora City Council axed a proposal by CM Marcano to ban the use of tear gas and other military-grade equipment by APD</a>. Marcano plans to edit the measure and bring it forward again. Mayor Coffman, of course, wrote that &quot;I believe that having these additional tools makes it less likely that our police department would ever have to resort to options that could cause physical injury, such as the use of wooden billy clubs, that can cause bone fractures, or rubber bullets, that can cause permanent loss of an eye, to accomplish the same purpose of (dispersing) a crowd (that) is becoming violent.” Did he not see that APD used everything at its disposal at various protests in Aurora this summer?</p> <p>A group called Community E also led a group of about 30 protestors <a href="https://sentinelcolorado.com/news/metro/demonstrators-confront-aurora-lawmaker-at-her-home-sunday-protesting-death-of-elijah-mcclain/">to the home of CM Bergan to protest the death of Elijah McClain</a>. There will be future protests. As this one was not sanctioned by the mother of Elijah McClain, it was not added to the calendar, but if future ones focus on other topics, they will be added to this thread and to the calendar.</p> <h1>Notable Events</h1> <h3>September 14</h3> <p><strong>4:00 PM - 6:00 PM</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/afrofrontco/status/1301688029447434240?s=21">Can You Hear Us Now?</a> (Twitter post)</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> Afro Liberation Front</p> <p><em>Location:</em> East steps of City Hall (1437 Bannock St, Denver, CO)</p> <p><em>Host-provided information:</em> Currently, the city charter of Denver prohibits bargaining over officers’ discipline, policing policies, and oversight.

Heck, if you feel like coming down, these meetings are open to the public and we welcome you to bring your mask, snacks, cushions and hang out to make sure we do the job you hired us to do. You are our bosses so don&#39;t let your employees slack on the job. This is your house and we need you. There is a weekly general public comment at 5 PM, 30 minutes before our council meeting, where you can share ANYTHING you like before the council. </p> <p><em>Type of Event:</em> Government Meeting</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p><strong>6:30 PM - 8:30 PM</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/melanatedmic/status/1305204657900322816?s=20">Melanated Mic Night</a> (Twitter post)</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> Community-organized</p> <p><em>Location:</em> Fuller Park</p> <p><em>Host-provided information:</em> We look forward to hearing new voices, and continuing amplifying/uplifting voices who have spoken in the past</p> <p><em>Type of Event:</em> Arts/Training</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <h3>September 16</h3> <p><strong>6:00 PM - 7:15 PM</strong> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/311567203256608">BLACK LIVES MATTER: An Evening with the Founders</a> (Facebook event)</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> CU Boulder Distinguished Speakers Board, CU Boulder, </p> <p><em>Location:</em> Online (<a href="http://bit.ly/BLM-event-registration">http://bit.ly/BLM-event-registration</a>)</p> <p><em>Host-provided information:</em> CU Boulder’s student-led Cultural Events Board and Distinguished Speakers Board are co-sponsoring a Sept. 16 event featuring the co-creators of the viral hashtag and movement: #BlackLivesMatter.

Those arrested were the leaders to demand justice for Elijah McClain, who was brutally murdered by the Aurora Police Department. They are still in jail, with the exception of one person. They are facing multiple felony charges and years in prison in an obvious frame-up aimed at stopping the movement for justice for Elijah McClain. Add your name to sign the petition and join the campaign to demand that all the charges be dropped!
