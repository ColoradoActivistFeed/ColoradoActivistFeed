      <title>Guidelines on Filming Police: Your rights, Your property</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.boulderdsa.org/resources/documents/FilmThePolice.pdf">https://www.boulderdsa.org/resources/documents/FilmThePolice.pdf</a> (about a 3 minute read)</p> <p>This is a pdf put together by the Boulder Democratic Socialists of America. Some of the advice and laws listed are specific to Boulder but a lot of the information is applicable as Colorado State Law and Statutes. <strong>Info Includes:</strong> Colorado Revised Statutes; a refresher on your rights in this situation; what an officer can ask you if detained, and interacting with non-police persons who are filmed due to your filming of police activity.</p> <p><a href="https://www.hmichaelsteinberg.com/can-the-police-stop-the-public-recording-of-their-actions.html">https://www.hmichaelsteinberg.com/can-the-police-stop-the-public-recording-of-their-actions.html</a> (about a 3 minute read)</p> <p>This is great info written by a Denver Defense Attorney, applicable for Colorado, not specific to any city. <strong>Info Includes:</strong> Your First Amendment Right To Record The Actions Of The Police,&amp; A 2015 Colorado Law That Allows For A Private Civil Lawsuit Against Police Who Violate Your Right To Record</p> <p><strong>Two Main Points</strong> (although I strongly recommend reading these through if you have time)<strong>:</strong> </p> <ol> <li><em>Colorado Revised Statutes 16-3-311. Peace officer incident recordings</em> • “(1) A person has the right to lawfully record any incident involving a peace officer and to maintain custody and control of that recording and the device used to record the recording. A peace officer shall not seize a recording or recording device without consent, without a search warrant or subpoena, or without a lawful exception to the warrant requirement.” <sup>• An officer can request to “obtain from a person a device used to record an incident involving a peace officer in order to access the recording as possible evidence in an investigation.” Tell them “I do not consent or volunteer to you taking my camera.” • (e</sup> Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a peace officer has the authority to temporarily seize and maintain control over a device that was used to record an incident involving a peace officer for no longer than seventy-two hours to obtain a search warrant when exigent circumstances exist such that the peace officer believes it is necessary to save a life or when the peace officer has a reasonable, articulable, goodfaith belief that seizure of the device is necessary to prevent the destruction of the evidentiary recording while a warrant is obtained.)</li> <li>You must avoid &quot;interfering&quot; with the investigation/actions. It is a good idea to STATE that you are a reasonable distance away for your video&#39;s audience (whether it be the courts if your camera gets seized, or just for viewers on a livestream. Try to take away any ambiguity or room for interpretation. In Boulder, this means staying at least 8 feet away; I did NOT FIND ANY SPECIFIC DISTANCE FOR DENVER, so if the police say to move back, that might be precedence to say you are interfering.</li> </ol> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Alarmed_Chard_4568"> /u/Alarmed_Chard_4568 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iuy9pg/guidelines_on_filming_police_your_rights_your/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iuy9pg/guidelines_on_filming_police_your_rights_your/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>PSL just put out the call: they will be organizing an emergency mobilization this Saturday 9/19 at 12PM at the west steps of the Capitol building, demanding justice for Elijah McClain, demanding that the killer cops be accountable for murder, and to demand the charges are dropped!</p> <p>Facebook details:</p> <p>BREAKING: On Sept. 17, police agencies in the Denver area arrested anti-racist organizers in a coordinated assault. People were arrested in a Home Depot parking lot, at their homes, and after they were pulled over while driving. Those arrested were the leaders to demand justice for Elijah McClain, who was brutally murdered by the Aurora Police Department. They are still in jail, with the exception of one person. They are facing multiple felony charges and years in prison in an obvious frame-up aimed at stopping the movement for justice for Elijah McClain.</p> <p>Add your name to sign the petition and join the campaign to demand that all the charges be dropped!</p> <p>Petition text:</p> <p>I demand that all charges be dropped on anti-racist organizers in the Denver area.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone. A few of us from the Boulder County NAACP Education Committee are working on a statewide bill to address disproportionate discipline of students of color, especially Black students, in Colorado schools. Key components of the bill would be: </p> <p>- Removing police officers (also known as SROs) from all day-to-day school operations; research shows that increases in SROs result in increased disproportionate discipline of Black and low-income students, decreases in high school graduation rates, and decreases in college enrollment rates. In Colorado schools, students of color and special education/504 plan students are disproportionately referred to law enforcement and/or arrested in school. Ideally we would like to see them replaced with social workers, counselors, etc. for day-to-day behavioral issues. </p> <p>- Increased accountability/data reporting around school discipline; For example, currently &quot;other action&quot; is the most commonly used category in the discipline data, and it could range from anything as mild as a detention to something as severe as a legal citation. This catch-all category inhibits transparency. There is also no data released about interactions between race and SPED/504 status. This is important to see - a Black SPED student, for example, could face multiple forms of bias and be even more negatively impacted by these discipline practices. </p> <p>- Teacher training around implicit bias and discipline practices; currently this is up to the districts - some districts are very enthusiastic about training teachers in this area and some refuse to do it, or keep it very minimal. &quot;Train the trainer&quot; models have proven effective for other areas of teacher training and can be implemented at a fairly low cost. </p> <p>Please fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Mp3VdV303beVUISgzVbkqv-1IuJ5FnKQv9wbXBFZdKI/edit">this google form</a> if you&#39;d like to get involved in our efforts. We&#39;re looking for help with outreach, email/admin management, partnership with other community organizations, eliciting testimony from students/parents, research on funding for SROs (varies by district), data analysis, and more. We&#39;re hoping to move quickly on this so any help is appreciated! </p> <p>You can also email us at [<a href="mailto:co.safeschools.bill@gmail.com">co.safeschools.bill@gmail.com</a>](mailto:<a href="mailto:co.safeschools.bill@gmail.com">co.safeschools.bill@gmail.com</a>).

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Please see our <a href="https://mailfence.com/pub/cal/denverprotestsdaily?a=1">new calendar</a> for the most complete list of upcoming vetted events. </p> <p>Events are color coded as follows:</p> <ul> <li>red: rally/protest/march</li> <li>purple: campaign (an event allowing activity spanning across several days)</li> <li>blue: government meeting</li> <li>yellow: education/training</li> <li>green: news</li> <li>orange: panel</li> <li>black: vigil</li> <li>pink: mutual aid</li> </ul> <h1>Wiki</h1> <p>To avoid repeating too much information from day to day, we&#39;ve created the beginnings of a wiki <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/wiki/index">here</a>. Your feedback is much needed, as this is my (TaroPeril&#39;s) first experience with a reddit wiki. It contains links to livestreamers, your rights as a protestor, and more.</p> <h1>News</h1> <p>DPD shot two men in the span of 72 hours last week - <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/09/11/denver-police-shooting-west-high-school-identified/">Antonio Blackbear, the cousin of Paul Castaway</a> on September 10 and then <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/09/12/denver-police-shooting-saturday-west-colfax/">one as-of-yet unnamed man</a> on September 12. Then, they broke up a memorial service for Antonio Blackbear on the night of Friday, September 11, and <a href="https://twitter.com/__ovas__/status/1304662954735030272?s=20">arrested several protestors</a>. </p> <p>The Denver City Council will also be voting on the collective bargaining proposal agreed upon by Mayor Hancock and DPD. This proposal guarantees a 2.77% raise for all of DPD, at a time when other city departments are being furloughed and otherwise having their budgets slashed. <a href="https://www.westword.com/news/denver-city-council-poised-to-reject-police-bargaining-agreement-11788153">Five councilmembers have so far stated publicly that they will vote against this proposal</a>, which was negotiated behind closed doors. Only two more councilmembers are needed for a majority. If they turn down this proposal, this will be the first time ever that such an agreement has been rejected by the City Council. Contact your rep today!</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://sentinelcolorado.com/news/metro/aurora-council-committee-axes-2-proposals-approves-another-targeting-military-devices-tear-gas/">Aurora City Council axed a proposal by CM Marcano to ban the use of tear gas and other military-grade equipment by APD</a>. Marcano plans to edit the measure and bring it forward again. Mayor Coffman, of course, wrote that &quot;I believe that having these additional tools makes it less likely that our police department would ever have to resort to options that could cause physical injury, such as the use of wooden billy clubs, that can cause bone fractures, or rubber bullets, that can cause permanent loss of an eye, to accomplish the same purpose of (dispersing) a crowd (that) is becoming violent.” Did he not see that APD used everything at its disposal at various protests in Aurora this summer?</p> <p>A group called Community E also led a group of about 30 protestors <a href="https://sentinelcolorado.com/news/metro/demonstrators-confront-aurora-lawmaker-at-her-home-sunday-protesting-death-of-elijah-mcclain/">to the home of CM Bergan to protest the death of Elijah McClain</a>. There will be future protests. As this one was not sanctioned by the mother of Elijah McClain, it was not added to the calendar, but if future ones focus on other topics, they will be added to this thread and to the calendar.</p> <h1>Notable Events</h1> <h3>September 14</h3> <p><strong>4:00 PM - 6:00 PM</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/afrofrontco/status/1301688029447434240?s=21">Can You Hear Us Now?</a> (Twitter post)</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> Afro Liberation Front</p> <p><em>Location:</em> East steps of City Hall (1437 Bannock St, Denver, CO)</p> <p><em>Host-provided information:</em> Currently, the city charter of Denver prohibits bargaining over officers’ discipline, policing policies, and oversight.
