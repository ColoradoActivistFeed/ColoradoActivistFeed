      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone, TaroPeril here. You&#39;ve probably noticed that the number of weekly events have been dwindling for a while. I&#39;ve been scouring as many places as I can think of, but it seems that active protests have gone into hibernation for a little while, so I&#39;m going to keep this single pinned thread up for the next several weeks, and maybe months. We&#39;ll see where we are in the new year. I&#39;ll still be around, and if I see any new and notable events scheduled, I&#39;ll put it here. You&#39;re always welcome to DM me with any you find, too!</p> <p>Please see our <a href="https://mailfence.com/pub/cal/denverprotestsdaily?a=1">new calendar</a> for the most complete list of upcoming vetted events.</p> <p>Events are color coded as follows:</p> <ul> <li>red: rally/protest/march</li> <li>purple: campaign (an event allowing activity spanning across several days)</li> <li>blue: government meeting</li> <li>yellow: education/training</li> <li>green: news</li> <li>orange: panel</li> <li>black: vigil</li> <li>pink: mutual aid</li> </ul> <h1>Wiki</h1> <p>To avoid repeating too much information from day to day, we&#39;ve created the beginnings of a wiki <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/wiki/index">here</a>. Your feedback is much needed, as this is my (TaroPeril&#39;s) first experience with a reddit wiki. It contains links to livestreamers, your rights as a protestor, and more.</p> <h1>Notable Events</h1> <p>Mondays</p> <p><strong>4:30 PM - 6:30 PM</strong> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2812391055659964">Winter Survival â€“ Full Court Press</a> (Facebook event)</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> Coach MK Fleming and Wall of Moms Denver </p> <p><em>Location:</em> 1431 Bannock St, Denver, CO 80202 </p> <p><em>Host-provided information:</em> Mayor Hancock is a disgrace, refusing to keep his campaign promise to assist the unhoused, and has unleashed a reign of terror on the most vulnerable in the form of sweeps, wasting our tax dollars during an economic recession. NO MORE. We need to be inside the meeting screaming at our reps and outside the building demonstrating <a href="/u/DenverCityCouncil">u/DenverCityCouncil</a>&#39;s utter failure to legislate. Community leaders will be demonstrating how to make survival items for the unhoused while I curse about how unnecessary this should be and demand that City Council press Hancock for #SolutionsNotSweeps in the 2021 budget, the first step to #defundthepolice and reallocate precious dollars to be invested in community SOLUTIONS. </p> <p><em>Type of Event:</em> Rally/March</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p><strong>5:30 PM</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/melanatedmic">Melanated Mic Night</a> (Twitter post)</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> Community-organized</p> <p><em>Location:</em> Online while it&#39;s cold outside.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello comrades! I really want to do more activism and protests but alas, I have no friends (or at least none that are into activism) which makes things a little difficult for me. I have chronic pain and other illnesses so going to a protest by myself is super dangerous for me. I&#39;m looking for people to buddy up with in case my body craps out on me. If any of you comrades want to help me out please DM me. the last time I went to a protest my adrenaline kept me strong throughout but there&#39;s no guarantee that that&#39;ll be the case every time. Thank you to all the people out there fighting the good fight.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Theghostvaquero"> /u/Theghostvaquero </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/k4t260/protest_buddy/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/k4t260/protest_buddy/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll try to be short, I&#39;m trying my best to handle family without smoking 17 blunts. Currently failing. </p> <p>So in my culture when warriors battle together they became akin to brothers, when women breast fed each others children they would be bonded likewise by a shared purpose. If you have been out on the streets with us, facing the same enemy then you are my family, period. If you have washed pepper spray out of a protesters eyes or recorded the actions of our oppressors then you are my family. </p> <p>To our white family out there and those who feel pushed aside and divided off. To those who identify as socialist and those who might be labeled as antifa, to just those who just listen to nickelback every once in a while. Be patient and understanding with us, we are a wounded animal right now. Understand that what we are asking for from you is help freeing ourselves first and then help us tend to our wounds once free. This is an emotionally charged time and with the atmosphere being what it is we may lash out if we feel that the movement is not being lead by our own. It should be understandable, we are traumatized by our histories. But just because tensions are high and we disagree with certain tactics does not mean we dont love you. We need you out there with us. I&#39;m sorry for the divisions in our movement but if no one has told you you&#39;re appreciated I will. I love you all for what you put on the line every time you&#39;re out on the streets. I love the crazy helmet heads who will literally take a bullet for our family. I love the socialist who understands that the entire machine is corrupt and was designed that way. I love the melenated family out there, going against our own self-preservation instict because we cannot stop FEELING, we go against everything taught to us by showing up and demanding equality. That shared feeling, that very resilient monster called empathy is why we are out there. We win as long as we keep feeling. Every single person out there has a place.Stay angry and stay intense.</p> <p>To those that don&#39;t feel quite wanted at our events please understand that you are needed. Dont abandon us, just respect that first for our cause is stopping the ease in which our melenated family is killed. That is what we need to stop right now and acknowledging that is not saying our other demands will never be gained. We&#39;ll succeed in our lifetime but the very first thing we need is a more balanced judicial system. Militia groups might be a fucked up problem but we would like our taxpayer dollars to stop being used for our own peoples murders.</p> <p>If you are thinking that our movement is too toxic or stagnant you are not alone but please do not abandon us. Honestly this might take years but we need you for what only you can bring. If you are considering coming to an event but feel overwhelmed, we need YOU. You will bring something thing to our family that we need. I love you all, thank you for everything. Reclaim the system, take care of one another.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheHungryShaman"> /u/TheHungryShaman </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/k1hcvh/a_love_letter/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/k1hcvh/a_love_letter/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>
