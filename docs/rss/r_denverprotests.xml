      <title>Help Undo the Damage Done By Wald!!!</title>

      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Recent marches have grown significantly once on the move. That say&#39;s there’s a bigger appetite to be in the streets and people just don’t know where to go, but they joined it when they saw it. After events there are people at home who are like ‘Damn - how did they know to be there’, we need to connect with them and right now we have a chance. Channel 93.3 is running a campaign about ‘What are you doing to be anti-racist’. We can use this to significantly boost the calendar and let people know where to go. We need marketing to get our events outside of the bubble they’re in. Now is Our Chance!!!</p> <p>Wald, Hancock, and DPD shut down the masses, the program on the radio station is a way to activate them again so we can roll deep. It’s the ultimate F-you from us to them.</p> <p><strong>Primary Call to Action:</strong></p> <p>Contact the station and DJs and tell them a big part of being anti-racist is showing up and this calendar helps tell me where to go and ask them to talk about the calendar when they talk about the anti-racist program and to boost it on their socials. Please include the link to the wiki that has the calendar in it as there are issues when you try and copy paste the calendar link.</p> <p><strong>Secondary:</strong> Submit an audio file for the contest. Find a way to plug the calendar.</p> <p>Getting them to consistently push the calendar on air and boost through their social’s will reach way more people than if they choose to play your audio file once or twice, so spend your time accordingly.</p> <p>Also – if successful, this may drive more traffic here, so clean up your stuff by following Taro’s excellent advice of editing your post and then deleting it.</p> <p><strong>Here’s how to contact them:</strong></p> <p><strong>The Station:</strong></p> <p>Three 0 Three 631– Two933<br/> Twitter - KTCLchannel933<br/> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ktclchannel933/">instagram.com/ktclchannel933/</a><br/> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KTCLChannel933">facebook.com/KTCLChannel933</a></p> <p><strong>Morning Rush: Steve Burrell</strong></p> <p>Twitter - iHeartSteveB<br/> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/iHeartSteveB/">instagram.com/iHeartSteveB/</a><br/> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SteveBurrell303">facebook.com/SteveBurrell303</a></p> <p><strong>Midday: Smitty</strong></p> <p>Twitter - LinSmitty<br/> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/smittyonair/">instagram.com/smittyonair/</a><br/> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SmittyOnAir">facebook.com/SmittyOnAir</a></p> <p><strong>Afternoon Rush: Nerf</strong></p> <p>Twitter - DJNerf<br/> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nerf933/">instagram.com/nerf933/</a><br/> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/933nerf">facebook.com/933nerf</a></p> <p><strong>Sunday Nights: Alf</strong></p> <p>Twitter - alf933<br/> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SundayNightsWithAlf">facebook.com/SundayNightsWithAlf</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Stand4SomethingCo"> /u/Stand4SomethingCo </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/izdttu/help_undo_the_damage_done_by_wald/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/izdttu/help_undo_the_damage_done_by_wald/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>If someone is blocking traffic, it does not give you the right to commit vehicular assault</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t believe I have to come on here and say this, but there are a significant number of right wing apologists who seem to think that just because protesters are blocking traffic, it makes it okay to drive through them, or even run them over.</p> <p>I know a lot of this rhetoric is coming from trolls, but I think there are honestly a fair number of people out there who believe it as well. </p> <p>If you fall into the latter category ask yourself this question. Would you be okay with this if it is another group of people besides protesters? Have you ever been on Blake Street after a Rockies game lets out? People fill the streets &quot;illegally&quot; all the time after the game, does that mean if I&#39;m driving on Blake, it&#39;s okay to just plow through those people, potentially injuring or killing them simply because they were in the street when they shouldn&#39;t have been? Just because someone inconveniences you and is potentially violating a traffic law does not make it okay for you to use your vehicle as a weapon against them. That&#39;s some extreme sociopathic behavior.</p> <p>With so many people who share this attitude is it any wonder we are in the situation we are in? If people think that any minor infraction is justification for harming or killing the &quot;criminal,&quot; is it any surprise that when the police kill &quot;criminals&quot; for not complying with police instructions, resisting arrest, or even being associated with someone who is a criminal that they continue to support the police? They&#39;ve already made it clear that in their mind, the moment someone commits any crime, no matter how negligible, that they were in the wrong and anything that happens to them up to and including being killed is their fault.</p> <p>Now I already know how the trolls are going to respond to this, so will go ahead and retort. They will say that &quot;The protesters were threatening them, hitting their vehicle, shouting at them. They felt threatened and had to get out of there. They were just defending themselves.&quot;</p> <p>The problem with that is that you don&#39;t get to claim self defense when you are the one who instigated the confrontation. You saw those people in the street. You had the opportunity to stop and either wait for them to move or turn around. Instead you decided to drive through a crowd of people.</p> <p>Lets change the scenario and replace the car with a gun. You are walking down the sidewalk and see some people up ahead blocking your path. You walk up to them and when they won&#39;t move out of your way you pull a gun on them and demand that they move. They start yelling at you, demanding that you put down the gun. They surround you and threaten to kick your ass for pulling a gun on them. Then you start shooting because you &quot;felt threatened.&quot; You cannot claim self defense here because you are the one who pulled the gun out in the first place and started the confrontation. It&#39;s no different when the deadly weapon is a car instead of a gun.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/drakoran"> /u/drakoran </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iyy3or/if_someone_is_blocking_traffic_it_does_not_give/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iyy3or/if_someone_is_blocking_traffic_it_does_not_give/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

Those arrested included leaders of the large-scale peaceful protests over the past few months that demanded justice for Elijah McClain, who was brutally murdered by the Aurora Police Department. They are facing multiple felony charges and years in prison in an obvious frame-up aimed at stopping the movement for justice for Elijah McClain. </p> <p>We are mounting a vigorous political and legal effort demanding that this frame up be stopped and that all charges be dropped. This attack on the Denver anti-racist movement, the PSL and the Black Lives Matter movement, is also a part of a concerted nation-wide assault against people engaged in massive protests demanding an end to police violence. The Trump administration, mayors and local police chiefs have been working all over the country to suppress this historic movement that seeks far reaching change and demands accountability from violent police officers. </p> <p>We are not afraid! We have the power of the people and justice on our side! Stand up, fight back! Drop the charges now! Join us for a rally and march beginning at the west steps of the State Capitol building in Denver at noon on Saturday, September 26.</p> <p><em>Type of Event:</em> Protest/Rally</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <h3>September 27</h3> <p><strong>1:00 PM - 3:00 PM</strong> <a href="https://catsnotcops.com/community-cares-march">Community outreach</a> (Website)</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> Community outreach</p> <p><em>Location:</em> Tivoli Quad (Walnut &amp; 11th St)</p> <p><em>Host-provided information:</em> Give back and support the community 9-27-20.
