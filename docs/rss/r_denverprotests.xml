PSL held a rally for the six arrested on Saturday, September 19, and has pledged to hold another one on the following Saturday, September 26. <a href="https://twitter.com/FreedomFundCO/status/1307856801774403584?s=20">Three of the people imprisoned, all members of PSL, have still not been bonded out</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://ktcl.iheart.com/contests/channel-93-3-s-say-something-869744/">Channel 93.3 is running a Say Something event</a> in which people can call in and discuss what they&#39;re doing to fight racism.

Those arrested included leaders of the large-scale peaceful protests over the past few months that demanded justice for Elijah McClain, who was brutally murdered by the Aurora Police Department. They are facing multiple felony charges and years in prison in an obvious frame-up aimed at stopping the movement for justice for Elijah McClain. </p> <p>We are mounting a vigorous political and legal effort demanding that this frame up be stopped and that all charges be dropped. This attack on the Denver anti-racist movement, the PSL and the Black Lives Matter movement, is also a part of a concerted nation-wide assault against people engaged in massive protests demanding an end to police violence. The Trump administration, mayors and local police chiefs have been working all over the country to suppress this historic movement that seeks far reaching change and demands accountability from violent police officers. </p> <p>We are not afraid! We have the power of the people and justice on our side! Stand up, fight back! Drop the charges now! Join us for a rally and march beginning at the west steps of the State Capitol building in Denver at noon on Saturday, September 26.</p> <p><em>Type of Event:</em> Protest/Rally</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/denverprotestsdaily"> /u/denverprotestsdaily </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iwt3m7/whats_happening_the_week_of_september_21_27/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iwt3m7/whats_happening_the_week_of_september_21_27/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Question about Melanated Mic Night (sept 21)</title>

      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey <a href="/r/Denverprotests">r/Denverprotests</a>, </p> <p>I&#39;m a white high school teacher, and some of my students are interested in attending Melanated Mic Night tomorrow. Right now, the only kids interested identify as POCs, but I could imagine that some of my white students may end up wanting to attend tomorrow, too. I haven&#39;t been out for this event yet, so I&#39;m hoping those of you familiar with the event can give me some guidance (cannot seem to DM Melanated Mic organizers on twitter).</p> <p>Is this a BIPOC-only space? Would it be appropriate 1) for me to attend and 2) to potentially bring white students with me? I will be clear with my students who are not POCs that we are there to listen, learn, witness, amplify BIPOC voices, and stand in solidarity, *NOT* to get airtime on the mic. All students I might bring are involved in supporting BLM; I absolutely will not bring any students who would be disruptive. If this is community event by and for BIPOC folks and white allies are better off showing up to something else, though, that&#39;s cool - definitely don&#39;t want to insert myself &amp; my students inappropriately!</p> <p>Any advice? Thanks so much for your help!!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/living_foggy"> /u/living_foggy </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iwmmg2/question_about_melanated_mic_night_sept_21/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iwmmg2/question_about_melanated_mic_night_sept_21/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll address this to the cops reading, because they&#39;re the ones who obviously least understand what&#39;s happening here.</p> <p>People just wanted some better ways to be involved in the &#39;good&#39; side of law enforcement, instead of always feeling like your enemies. We just wanted some accountability for the bad apples who went too far, and for enforcement to be a bit more consistent and a bit less arbitrary.</p> <p>People protested non-violently, peacefully. No one tracked down cops to their homes and threw molotovs into your windows. No one went out and shot up cops in revenge for any of the stuff your bad apples did.</p> <p>People just wanted justice, and all they&#39;ve done is asked for it. When we think the system is unjust and it refuses to change, we can be loud and we can get in the way of things because it&#39;s important to us, but we don&#39;t go committing the types of massacres that have are all-too frequently perpetrated by right-wing extremists.</p> <p>It doesn&#39;t seem to matter what people do, you refuse to give even the smallest concessions. You protect your bad apples until all that&#39;s visible to the outside world is rot. You brutally attack people who non-violently ask for these small changes. You help extremists commit terror attacks.</p> <p>And now, you want to put peaceful protesters in prison. People have done nothing to hurt anyone, to whom the worst accusations you can make are that they walked and they spoke and you didn&#39;t like where they walked and what they said.</p> <p>What do you think is going to happen when people peacefully demanding justice know that they&#39;ll face life in prison for marching? What remains, for the people who think that this injustice cannot stand without doing something?</p> <p>Your intention, of course, was to make people afraid that if they protest, they will go to prison for life. Your idea was that people who fight for justice will stop fighting because they will not want to spend their lives in prison.</p> <p>I hope I&#39;m wrong, but the flip side to your imprisoning peaceful people for life is that some who were remaining peaceful may make the calculation that now all paths towards justice lead to prison anyway. Those options that were off the table before may not seem as extreme when the consequence is life in prison regardless... <em>if they get caught</em>.</p> <p>Because when weighing up options for getting justice now, the decision must be made between publicly protesting and facing the wrath of a fascistic legal system, or taking more covert action.</p> <p>I hope that this is just my own anxieties and that all the charges are dropped against people who have been non-violently asking for justice. After seeing the horrible LASD ambush the other day I know that <em>no one wants to live a world where anyone thinks that kind of violence is their only way to obtain justice</em>.</p> <p>JFK quote here.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ilivoVovili"> /u/ilivoVovili </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iv4zn7/peaceful_protesters_are_facing_huge_prison/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iv4zn7/peaceful_protesters_are_facing_huge_prison/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>
