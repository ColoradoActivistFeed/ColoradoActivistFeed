      <title>If someone is blocking traffic, it does not give you the right to commit vehicular assault</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iyy3or/if_someone_is_blocking_traffic_it_does_not_give/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t believe I have to come on here and say this, but there are a significant number of right wing apologists who seem to think that just because protesters are blocking traffic, it makes it okay to drive through them, or even run them over.</p> <p>I know a lot of this rhetoric is coming from trolls, but I think there are honestly a fair number of people out there who believe it as well. </p> <p>If you fall into the latter category ask yourself this question. Would you be okay with this if it is another group of people besides protesters? Have you ever been on Blake Street after a Rockies game lets out? People fill the streets &quot;illegally&quot; all the time after the game, does that mean if I&#39;m driving on Blake, it&#39;s okay to just plow through those people, potentially injuring or killing them simply because they were in the street when they shouldn&#39;t have been? Just because someone inconveniences you and is potentially violating a traffic law does not make it okay for you to use your vehicle as a weapon against them. That&#39;s some extreme sociopathic behavior.</p> <p>With so many people who share this attitude is it any wonder we are in the situation we are in? If people think that any minor infraction is justification for harming or killing the &quot;criminal,&quot; is it any surprise that when the police kill &quot;criminals&quot; for not complying with police instructions, resisting arrest, or even being associated with someone who is a criminal that they continue to support the police? They&#39;ve already made it clear that in their mind, the moment someone commits any crime, no matter how negligible, that they were in the wrong and anything that happens to them up to and including being killed is their fault.</p> <p>Now I already know how the trolls are going to respond to this, so will go ahead and retort. They will say that &quot;The protesters were threatening them, hitting their vehicle, shouting at them. They felt threatened and had to get out of there. They were just defending themselves.&quot;</p> <p>The problem with that is that you don&#39;t get to claim self defense when you are the one who instigated the confrontation. You saw those people in the street. You had the opportunity to stop and either wait for them to move or turn around. Instead you decided to drive through a crowd of people.</p> <p>Lets change the scenario and replace the car with a gun. You are walking down the sidewalk and see some people up ahead blocking your path. You walk up to them and when they won&#39;t move out of your way you pull a gun on them and demand that they move. They start yelling at you, demanding that you put down the gun. They surround you and threaten to kick your ass for pulling a gun on them. Then you start shooting because you &quot;felt threatened.&quot; You cannot claim self defense here because you are the one who pulled the gun out in the first place and started the confrontation. It&#39;s no different when the deadly weapon is a car instead of a gun.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/drakoran"> /u/drakoran </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iyy3or/if_someone_is_blocking_traffic_it_does_not_give/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iyy3or/if_someone_is_blocking_traffic_it_does_not_give/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

PSL held a rally for the six arrested on Saturday, September 19, and has pledged to hold another one on the following Saturday, September 26. <a href="https://twitter.com/FreedomFundCO/status/1307856801774403584?s=20">Three of the people imprisoned, all members of PSL, have still not been bonded out</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://ktcl.iheart.com/contests/channel-93-3-s-say-something-869744/">Channel 93.3 is running a Say Something event</a> in which people can call in and discuss what they&#39;re doing to fight racism.

Those arrested included leaders of the large-scale peaceful protests over the past few months that demanded justice for Elijah McClain, who was brutally murdered by the Aurora Police Department. They are facing multiple felony charges and years in prison in an obvious frame-up aimed at stopping the movement for justice for Elijah McClain. </p> <p>We are mounting a vigorous political and legal effort demanding that this frame up be stopped and that all charges be dropped. This attack on the Denver anti-racist movement, the PSL and the Black Lives Matter movement, is also a part of a concerted nation-wide assault against people engaged in massive protests demanding an end to police violence. The Trump administration, mayors and local police chiefs have been working all over the country to suppress this historic movement that seeks far reaching change and demands accountability from violent police officers. </p> <p>We are not afraid! We have the power of the people and justice on our side! Stand up, fight back! Drop the charges now! Join us for a rally and march beginning at the west steps of the State Capitol building in Denver at noon on Saturday, September 26.</p> <p><em>Type of Event:</em> Protest/Rally</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/denverprotestsdaily"> /u/denverprotestsdaily </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iwt3m7/whats_happening_the_week_of_september_21_27/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iwt3m7/whats_happening_the_week_of_september_21_27/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>
