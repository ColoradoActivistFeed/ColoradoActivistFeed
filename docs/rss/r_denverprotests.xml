      <title>Re: The fence around the Capitol</title>

      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a Denver resident, but the past few times I&#39;ve been there I&#39;ve seen a fence around areas of the capitol building along with a state trooper(s) that seem to be there 24/7. I have a few questions</p> <ol> <li>Is that fence still there?</li> <li>if the fence is there, why is it there?</li> <li>is there any push to get the fence removed?</li> </ol> <p>Obviously, that is public land and the public has a right to be there. A recent video by Cuttheplastic shows similar fences going up for no reason throughout the city. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nns1GwBX-Zc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nns1GwBX-Zc</a></p> <p>How much land is going to be restricted from the public without real justification before there&#39;s a backlash? It looks like crap, costs the taxpayers money to erect and defend, restricts freedom of movement, discourages peaceful assembly, and is all around just an oppressive message to the public specifically targeted at those who choose to exercise their 1st amendment rights,</p> <p>Like honestly, fence costs aside, how much does it cost to station a state trooper there 24/7. They must make at least $20 an hour, plus gas costs, etc. The other day I saw like 5 state police there having a fucking picnic.</p> <p>What is going on here?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Buhdumtssss"> /u/Buhdumtssss </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iqy81o/re_the_fence_around_the_capitol/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iqy81o/re_the_fence_around_the_capitol/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>City Council this Monday!</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iqt2fa/city_council_this_monday/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Alright y&#39;all, the CBA - the collective bargaining agreement aka the contract with the police union - is here and being brought before city council this Monday. It was previously discussed in a committee meeting last Wednesday where several council members were concerned about being left out of the conversation with the Denver PPA. According to the city charter, a city council representative is supposed to be involved in negotiations from the beginning but because of the current political climate, the Denver police union &quot;accidentally&quot; left them out and kept early stages of negotiations internal and private. </p> <p>Despite this, the city council committee members at Wednesday&#39;s meeting decided to send this to the floor of the city council so all city council members could vote on whether to approve the contract or send it back for arbitration. The most glaring problem with the proposed contract is that it is a two-year contract rather than one. It essentially says that Denver police will not take a pay raise or holiday bonus in 2021 but they are ensured a 2.77% salary increase in 2022. </p> <p>We ALL need to be calling and emailing our city council representatives and urging them to send the CBA back for arbitration. We know cops do not deserve this raise. And city council members know that the collective bargaining agreement was not done in good faith; it was NOT collectively discussed. Play into their egos and ask them to reclaim their power on our behalf. And sign up for public comment to speak and tell the whole council what you think! Public comment signup is today at noon and slots fill fast:</p> <p><a href="https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_3GN7Zv99SluXrlm4UC8NLQ">https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_3GN7Zv99SluXrlm4UC8NLQ</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/antitruncher"> /u/antitruncher </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iqt2fa/city_council_this_monday/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iqt2fa/city_council_this_monday/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>One of the good things about the fenced in park is that it keeps police resources, usually 6-8 officers and a couple vehicles, out of the rest of Denver. </p> <p>There are no officers or vehicles currently inside the fence (as of about 9 PM), likely due to the weather. I imagine that any quickly organized demonstrations at the fence during this quick cold snap could be interesting.</p> <p>If they insist on keeping the fence up then we can at least make them dedicate the resources to guarding it 24/7, and if the displaced homeless have to be in the cold and the wet then it&#39;s only fair that a few officers join in.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HolidayInn-Cambodia"> /u/HolidayInn-Cambodia </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ip89xe/minimal_police_presence_at_the_former_capitol/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ip89xe/minimal_police_presence_at_the_former_capitol/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

We still have not seen justice for Elijah McClain, Paul Castaway, Breonna Taylor, Tamir Rice, Alton Sterling, Philando Castile, Mike Brown, Daniel Shaver, Eric Garner, John Crawford &amp; so many many more names before and after the murder of George Floyd this May. A murder that sparked that nationwide protest that will reach Day 100 this Friday Sept 4th. Since George’s heinous murder we have seen an increase of police aggression like never before, and even more embolden murders by those who stand firmly behind a thin blue line. Our voice have seem to go unheard over this summer, therefore let us make them loud and clear. Let us fill the streets with numbers that dwarf the beginning of this movement for the 4 day weekend, starting on Day 100. This time lets make it clear. We want Freedom! We want Justice! This is a peaceful family friendly weekend of protest, however with both increasing police aggression on even the most peaceful of events coupled with far right wing agitation please bring what you need to keep you and your family safe. Come and leave in groups, and have a pre planned exit route. This should be standard practice for any type of event. Again though this is a peaceful event with the recent events that have occurred in Denver over the course of August, it is important that we show up and show that Denver can still be peaceful. A Peaceful weekend will also increase our numbers through out the 4 days This is a community sourced event that evolved out of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iks9gv/sept_47_laborday_weekend_not_much_going_on/">community discussion</a> on <a href="/r/denverprotest">/r/denverprotest</a> on reddit, therefore we need your help to make this a big event and a successful one.</p> <p><em>Type of Event:</em> Protest</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <h3>September 7</h3> <h2>Denver</h2> <p><strong>3:00 PM - 5:00 PM</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/melanatedmic/status/1302306985551958016?s=21">Melanated Mic Night</a> (Twitter Post)</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> Community-organized</p> <p><em>Location:</em> Greek Ampitheatre at Civic Center Park</p> <p><em>Host-provided information:</em> Melanated mic night gives a voice for this melanated table.
