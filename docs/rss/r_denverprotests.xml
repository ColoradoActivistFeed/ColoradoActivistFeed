      <title>Lauren Boebert&#39;s Buddies</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/l336pp/lauren_boeberts_buddies/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Rep. Lauren Boebert CO-03 is connected to multiple far-right militias in Colorado.</p> <p>Working with the network of lovely people from <a href="/r/DenverProtests">r/DenverProtests</a>, I was able to get some intel that would further distinguish her from a congresswoman to a potential threat. She gave tours to large groups prior to the Jan 6 attack. She has multiple tweets citing, &quot;Today is 1776&quot;, roughly a few hours prior to the attack. She tweeted the location of Nancy Pelosi during the attack. </p> <p><em>But let&#39;s keep going</em>. One of the main militias caught at the Capitol Insurrection Attempt, the &#39;Three Percenters&#39;. Shooters Grill, located in Rifle, CO, is owned by the Boebert family (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb1VldFpRG8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb1VldFpRG8</a>). One of the beautiful men in the picture below was arrested for the connection of the Jan 6 attack, October 2018. The &#39;Three Percenters&#39; are defined by the SPLC as, &#39;dangerous anti-government extremists&#39;. The ADL has defined them as a &#39;heavily armed white supremacist group&#39;. They don&#39;t like immigrants, Muslims, LGBT, and BIPOC. They don&#39;t believe in COVID. They believe the BLM protests were funded by Soros and the jews. </p> <p>In Colorado, from 2019 - 2020 there have been 179 incidents of hate according to the ADL:[Extremeist Murders: 1, Terror Plots: 1, White Supremacist Events: 3, White Supremacist Propaganda: 81, Anti-Semitic Incidents: 103]</p> <p>Let&#39;s go down for the known crimes of the Three Percenters Militia:</p> <p><em>Clevland, Ohio, May 2020: FBI arrested</em> <strong><em>Christian Stanley</em></strong> <em>Ferguson with charges related to an alleged plot to ambush police</em></p> <p><em>Clarence, Illinois, July 2018:</em> <strong><em>Michael Hari</em></strong> <em>and several others were connected to a Minnesota Mosque bombing in August 2017 and a failed bombing attempt against an Illinois Abortion Clinic in November 2017.</em></p> <p><em>Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, August 2017:</em> <strong><em>Jerry Drake</em></strong> <em>was arrested because he was trying to detonate a truck bomb in front of a bank downtown.</em></p> <p><em>Garden City, Kansas, October 2016: 3 members were arrested in a conspiracy to deploy truck bombs to destroy a Muslim housing complex.</em></p> <p><em>Back to Boebert</em>. In June of 2020, she tweeted, &quot;I am the militia&quot;. Boebert of course said she doesn&#39;t know the traitor Robert Gieswein. Boebert said that she respected the Three Percenters&#39; right to discuss anti-government issues. However, the problem isn&#39;t the speech itself, the problem is when they go commit hate crimes. Robert Geiswein also created another paramilitary group called the &#39;Woodland Wild Dogs&#39;. </p> <p>In the second photo, December 2019, Bobert is on the Denver Capital stairs with friends using the &#39;Three Percenters&#39; hand sign. <strong>*Now deleted from her Facebook page*.</strong> </p> <p>She goes on these QAnon conspiracy theories. She has a past with openly identifying with known hate groups. She has pictures of her &quot;&quot;constituents&quot;&quot; wearing hate group merchandise and dressed in paramilitary gear. And then those constituents are caught doing undesirable things. She has multiple allegations of helping incite the insurrection. </p> <p><strong>The good news, the FBI is starting to investigate her background. Democrat and Republican representatives are calling her out and demanding her resignation. On 1/13, 68 Colorado elected officials requested an investigation due to her ties with the insurrection.</strong></p> <p>In Colorado, we have people like Boebert who happen to be involved with the worst things. But then there&#39;s us. We demand change. We want all people to be equal. We want all people to not be afraid to go outside because of who they are. We maintain a tolerant society, by not tolerating the intolerant. I appreciate everyone&#39;s help in the time of unrest and for creating a helpful community that not only benefits us but everyone around us. Protect and develop your communities. Cheers.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/wt954czrszc61.png?width=351&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e409a37938748551f956cfcc642aef32d36b273">Boeberts Buddies {3&#37;s outside Boeberts restaurant rocking the hand gestures.

Especially when it comes to Colorado a.k.a Laura Boebert (known ‘Q’ follower). </p> <p>After dissecting message boards, GTD, and interviews from the fascists mouth, here’s a quick list:</p> <p>Definitely: The Twin Outlaw Brotherhood Patriot Front Proud Boys</p> <p>Allegedly: American Identity Movement Atomwaffen Division</p> <p>All of these people who are definitely coming will be armed. Colorado State Patrol is setting up on the highways. Looking at the protests that are happening that day it looks as if they are going to try divide groups for possible arrests. </p> <p>I’ll update later.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/your_local_manager"> /u/your_local_manager </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/kwxdz6/security_update/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/kwxdz6/security_update/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>
