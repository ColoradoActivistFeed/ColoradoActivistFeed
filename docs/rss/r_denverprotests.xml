      <title>Special law enforcement parking at Walmart?</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was just at the Walmart grocery on chambers and Iliff in Aurora and the first spot s Closest to the door was empty but there was a sign there. I expected it to be one of those expectant mothers or veteran spots I have seen elsewhere but this one said something along the lines of &quot;For our friends in Law Enforcement.&quot; I pulled right out of the parking lot and went to King Soopers.</p> <p>I dont shop at that Walmart regularly but I do think that sign must be pretty new. Has anyone seen it at other Walmarts? I certainly will never shop at that location again. Also it would be a shame if something were to happen to that sign.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/drakoran"> /u/drakoran </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iihxx9/special_law_enforcement_parking_at_walmart/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iihxx9/special_law_enforcement_parking_at_walmart/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Thoughts on dealing with Proud Boiis</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iigndb/thoughts_on_dealing_with_proud_boiis/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Listen to <a href="https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-worst-year-ever-49377032/episode/the-weekend-of-so-many-different-70666328/">THIS</a> story of conflict-journalist turned nazi-puncher Robert Evans getting his hand broken by an anti-anti-fascist. He gives a great description of the kind of people that are showing up to counter-protest BLM. The proud boiis (originally a type-o but I’m gonna roll with it) and their white fragility/supremacy ilk are unquestionably dangerous, but not in the way they want to be. They’re trying to present themselves as serious, respectable people; a well-regulated militia of patriots who stand for law &amp; order with cool guns. They’re gonna fight SOCIALIST OPPRESSION and CANCEL CULTURE and the RADICAL LEFT in that <em>dashing</em> AR15/tac-vest combo. Tho, behind their expensive kit and <em>seriously very deadly</em> weaponry, these cosplaytriots are irrational, insecure, unpredictable people. </p> <p>Listening to Robert’s story, you get a sense the boiis could have panicked, opened fire into that crowd of hundreds, and gotten away in the chaos. The cops would let them go and probably high-five them on the way out. The president would say some inconsequential bullshit and they’d all get away with it. Kyle Rittenhouse was just the first. </p> <p>TLDR; tactics</p> <p>If our goal is keeping people safe* and unmurdered, we need to use purposeful de-escalation when encountering militant MAGA groups. Talk them down or ignore them like a loud baby brother. Stay tight at the shield wall and don’t let them rattle or move us. They&#39;ll want to escalate and provoke a violent response. Don’t give them any excuse to use their fancy toys. Throw balloons of pink, oil-based paint to distract and demoralize. Document everything in real time so you can try and hold them responsible later. The cops and feds can beat your ass and walk away, but these boiis don’t have legal immunity - yet.</p> <p>*If your plans do not include being safe, make sure everyone around is prepared, and have a plan.<br/> I&#39;m not trying to tell anyone how to protest, I&#39;m just offering some tactics. (Posting from an alt,) I’m a vet who’s been following the rise of American fascism. This is part of their plan: slowly ratchet up street violence and normalize a daily drumbeat of dead BLM/antifa. That way no one is surprised when they go full organized mass murder under the guise of self-defense. </p> <p>It’s only a matter of time before drunk bootlickers drop the pretense and just start shooting. If a situation escalates to gunfire, unfortunately my best advice is for everyone to hit the deck. Run, hide, or fight. Stay low and get behind something hard. Record or stream what&#39;s happening if you can.<br/> <del>Stay safe.</del> Be brave.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/iIIegaIstuff"> /u/iIIegaIstuff </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iigndb/thoughts_on_dealing_with_proud_boiis/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iigndb/thoughts_on_dealing_with_proud_boiis/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all! So, as many of us know, on Friday 8/28, it will be the 57th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. This year has also seen a resurgence of civil rights activism which makes for this anniversary extra special. As such, there are going to be several marches in solidarity for the main one in Washington DC, with some happening in Denver. However, I don&#39;t know which one I should go to. There is one happening at the capitol building and then there is one happening by the MLK statue near the Denver Zoo and most likely, even more, happening too. So I guess I&#39;m asking for advice on which one I should go to.</p> <p>Thoughts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Delta_6207"> /u/Delta_6207 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iho2x2/which_one/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iho2x2/which_one/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>
