Maybe this is just <a href="/r/offmychest">r/offmychest</a> material.</p> <p>First some background.</p> <p>My mother is an elementary school teacher, in her 60&#39;s with multiple underlying conditions. She&#39;s very liberal and usually incredibly nice and helpful. I had to move back in with her due to CoViD and how that made my financial situation untenable. She&#39;s been doing online schooling since April. Now, they&#39;re doing a slow roll on reopening the school, 1 or 2 grades at a time. They&#39;ve implemented a lot of security theater, but done very little to actually prevent spread.</p> <p>There are now confirmed CoViD cases in the school and all they&#39;ve done is send emails to parents saying everything is fine. Then they quarantined that class, even though the kids from all classes play together at recess. It has likely already spread.</p> <p>Now my mom&#39;s grade goes back next week, and I don&#39;t want her to die. Or have long lasting after effects. Or have my sister get it. Or me.</p> <p>For months, me and my little sister have been trying to get her to organize with her fellow teachers in order to better protect themselves from the bureaucratic bull that their admin imposes on them. She sees and agrees that she will likely get it from one of her kids, but refuses to even hear us out; to organize or do anything to improve the situation. When we try to talk to her or help bear the load, she literally slams the door on us.</p> <p>This was some rant, but it&#39;s denver local and I&#39;d like some advice from locals who organize.</p> <p>So, I have 3 questions:</p> <p>Is there any way I can get through to her?</p> <p>Is there anything I can do from the outside to try to improve the situation, to do the organizing for her, or make a picket, or something?</p> <p>Do I just resign myself to getting CoViD eventually and watching my family get sick too?</p> <p>Plz remove if not <a href="/r/Denverprotest">r/Denverprotest</a> material.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Berathor113"> /u/Berathor113 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ja6asr/covid_in_schools_and_i_dont_know_how_to_help/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ja6asr/covid_in_schools_and_i_dont_know_how_to_help/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Statement on Saturday&#39;s Counter Protest</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/j9xr9z/statement_on_saturdays_counter_protest/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>On Saturday, October 10th, the Denver Communists, W.I.T.C.H. Denver, the Front Range Mutual Aid Network, Colorado Socialist Revolution, and others held a rally to oppose and confront a fascist militia gathering. Canned and dry foods were collected and hot meals were cooked and served. We also set up tables under canopies to facilitate political conversation, distribute Marxist literature, and invite the people we meet to organize with us to grow the anti-racist, anti-fascist movement. By midafternoon all of our goals had been accomplished--most importantly our counter protest had outnumbered, drowned out, and driven off the fascist rally. </p> <p>As the ‘patriots’ shuffled off in defeat, a little over an hour after their assembly began, one of them struck, maced, and was subsequently shot and killed by another person. The best information we have is that the shooter was a Pinkerton security contractor employed by 9News, the local NBC affiliate. It has also come out that the person who was killed had violently attacked a Black Lives Matter protestor last summer and was aggressively confronting a Black man moments before the shooting. While we support the right to self-defense and encourage emancipatory collective self-defense independent of the capitalist state by the working class and the oppressed, we believe that our best defense is built with mass organization, not by individual acts of violence. Throughout the history of fascist and far-right organizing, mass movements of oppressed working class people mobilized to oppose them. This has proven to be the most effective, unequivocal and powerful solution. </p> <p>Our experience on Saturday bears this out. Without firing a shot, or even connecting with a soup can, we were able to effectively repel the gathering of III%ers, Oath Keepers, Proud Boys, and other white nationalists, while building closer contacts with other workers looking to organize against racism, fascism, and capitalism more broadly. Some media outlets reporting on the event, including the one who employed the alleged shooter, imply that the Denver Communists and others involved in opposing the far-right gathering were responsible for the shooting. This isn’t just incorrect, it inverts the situation entirely--had they been able to assemble without our opposition, the militia-fascists would have felt more empowered to exercise violence, not less. </p> <p>The police don’t do anything to stand against fascist violence-- not on Saturday nor this entire summer of mass uprising, not to speak of the historical camaraderie between cops and fascists. We’ve seen them work hand-in-hand with the armed right wing in Kenosha, Portland, and Minneapolis. It’s no different here in Denver where even when the police aren’t directly coordinating with militias and white-nationalist groups they’re always ready to defend them. On Saturday, while we fed the hungry with soup and communist politics, it was no coincidence that the police were facing our rally and kept their backs turned to the armed vigilantes behind them. We can’t rely on the state to oppose reactionary politics. Instead we seek to organize masses of workers to protect ourselves, our communities, and each other.</p> <p>If we recognize that our power to combat fascism comes from masses organized against it, that also means that our orientation needs to be to the public. While we acknowledge the importance of security and safeguarding those involved in organizing with us, we believe that many have mistaken obscurity with security. Instead, the Denver Communists are committed to organizing publicly, openly, and confidently. We don’t see any other way to grow the large, combative social movements that are necessary to fight the increasingly deadly status quo. After the success of the BLM-Antifa Soup Drive, we look forward to confronting the far right again the next time they rear their ugly heads. We encourage anyone interested in getting involved to attend our next meeting, over Zoom this Wednesday, where we’ll discuss our approach to organizing against the far right.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/denversocialists"> /u/denversocialists </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/j9xr9z/statement_on_saturdays_counter_protest/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/j9xr9z/statement_on_saturdays_counter_protest/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

Due to the lack of a stimulus package negotiation, millions of Americans aren&#39;t only suffering from Covid; they are suffering from poverty. What Harris said is the middle finger to all who are essential workers. They would let us die like good boys and girls, just for them to virtue signal our causes. While poverty has exploded, these politicians can eat brunch in their mansions.

Join us to peacefully gather and make your voice hear. If you have your own gear (sleeping bag, tarp, tent, etc) feel free to bring your own. However, we do not know what will happen with police response, so if needed to hold this space we may end up staying with minimal survival gear.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Like many of you, we have been feeling the need for better organization and information dissemination around activism in Colorado. After discussing with comrades and thinking this over, we think that something like a community activism hub would be really valuable and, if well designed and maintained, would fill many of the needs that aren&#39;t currently being well met. Below is a list of requirements/components for the hub. We&#39;re thinking that a website would be the best platform, but am open to other suggestions. </p> <p>Here&#39;s what we need from you: * If you or someone you know has tech expertise and can volunteer time to help design and implement this idea, please DM me. * We will also need volunteers to help generate content and monitor/maintain the site...kind of like the reddit mod role.<br/> * Lastly, if you would like to add to or change any of the requirements, please leave a comment below.</p> <p>We help us, let&#39;s make this happen!</p> <p>List of requirements/components for Colorado Activism Hub: - Searchable, taggable calendar of events (events ideally would be well-formatted and each have a risk rating) - Ability for members of the public to submit events for inclusion in the hub calendar - Searchable database of organizations and groups, with a page for each organization - List of causes (such as BLM, homelessness, LGBTQIA, etc.) - List of active fundraisers and drives, with the ability for members of the public to submit fundraisers for approval - List of ways to help (mutual aid, donating, letter-writing, etc) - Beginner&#39;s guide to protesting, mutual aid, etc. - List of educational resources - Twitter RSS feed for key organizers in the Denver area, and relevant hashtags</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/denverprotestsdaily"> /u/denverprotestsdaily </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/j825zd/ideas_and_volunteers_needed_colorado_activism_hub/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/j825zd/ideas_and_volunteers_needed_colorado_activism_hub/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>
