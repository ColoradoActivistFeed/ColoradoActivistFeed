      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Please see our <a href="https://mailfence.com/pub/cal/denverprotestsdaily?a=1">new calendar</a> for the most complete list of upcoming vetted events. </p> <p>Events are color coded as follows:</p> <ul> <li>red: rally/protest/march</li> <li>purple: campaign (an event allowing activity spanning across several days)</li> <li>blue: government meeting</li> <li>yellow: education/training</li> <li>green: news</li> <li>orange: panel</li> <li>black: vigil</li> <li>pink: mutual aid</li> </ul> <h1>Wiki</h1> <p>To avoid repeating too much information from day to day, we&#39;ve created the beginnings of a wiki <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/wiki/index">here</a>. Your feedback is much needed, as this is my (TaroPeril&#39;s) first experience with a reddit wiki. It contains links to livestreamers, your rights as a protestor, and more.</p> <h1>News</h1> <p>DPD shot two men in the span of 72 hours last week - <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/09/11/denver-police-shooting-west-high-school-identified/">Antonio Blackbear, the cousin of Paul Castaway</a> on September 10 and then <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/09/12/denver-police-shooting-saturday-west-colfax/">one as-of-yet unnamed man</a> on September 12. Then, they broke up a memorial service for Antonio Blackbear on the night of Friday, September 11, and <a href="https://twitter.com/__ovas__/status/1304662954735030272?s=20">arrested several protestors</a>. </p> <p>The Denver City Council will also be voting on the collective bargaining proposal agreed upon by Mayor Hancock and DPD. This proposal guarantees a 2.77% raise for all of DPD, at a time when other city departments are being furloughed and otherwise having their budgets slashed. <a href="https://www.westword.com/news/denver-city-council-poised-to-reject-police-bargaining-agreement-11788153">Five councilmembers have so far stated publicly that they will vote against this proposal</a>, which was negotiated behind closed doors. Only two more councilmembers are needed for a majority. If they turn down this proposal, this will be the first time ever that such an agreement has been rejected by the City Council. Contact your rep today!</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://sentinelcolorado.com/news/metro/aurora-council-committee-axes-2-proposals-approves-another-targeting-military-devices-tear-gas/">Aurora City Council axed a proposal by CM Marcano to ban the use of tear gas and other military-grade equipment by APD</a>. Marcano plans to edit the measure and bring it forward again. Mayor Coffman, of course, wrote that &quot;I believe that having these additional tools makes it less likely that our police department would ever have to resort to options that could cause physical injury, such as the use of wooden billy clubs, that can cause bone fractures, or rubber bullets, that can cause permanent loss of an eye, to accomplish the same purpose of (dispersing) a crowd (that) is becoming violent.” Did he not see that APD used everything at its disposal at various protests in Aurora this summer?</p> <p>A group called Community E also led a group of about 30 protestors <a href="https://sentinelcolorado.com/news/metro/demonstrators-confront-aurora-lawmaker-at-her-home-sunday-protesting-death-of-elijah-mcclain/">to the home of CM Bergan to protest the death of Elijah McClain</a>. There will be future protests. As this one was not sanctioned by the mother of Elijah McClain, it was not added to the calendar, but if future ones focus on other topics, they will be added to this thread and to the calendar.</p> <h1>Notable Events</h1> <h3>September 14</h3> <p><strong>4:00 PM - 6:00 PM</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/afrofrontco/status/1301688029447434240?s=21">Can You Hear Us Now?</a> (Twitter post)</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> Afro Liberation Front</p> <p><em>Location:</em> East steps of City Hall (1437 Bannock St, Denver, CO)</p> <p><em>Host-provided information:</em> Currently, the city charter of Denver prohibits bargaining over officers’ discipline, policing policies, and oversight.

      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a Denver resident, but the past few times I&#39;ve been there I&#39;ve seen a fence around areas of the capitol building along with a state trooper(s) that seem to be there 24/7. I have a few questions</p> <ol> <li>Is that fence still there?</li> <li>if the fence is there, why is it there?</li> <li>is there any push to get the fence removed?</li> </ol> <p>Obviously, that is public land and the public has a right to be there. A recent video by Cuttheplastic shows similar fences going up for no reason throughout the city. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nns1GwBX-Zc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nns1GwBX-Zc</a></p> <p>How much land is going to be restricted from the public without real justification before there&#39;s a backlash? It looks like crap, costs the taxpayers money to erect and defend, restricts freedom of movement, discourages peaceful assembly, and is all around just an oppressive message to the public specifically targeted at those who choose to exercise their 1st amendment rights,</p> <p>Like honestly, fence costs aside, how much does it cost to station a state trooper there 24/7. They must make at least $20 an hour, plus gas costs, etc. The other day I saw like 5 state police there having a fucking picnic.</p> <p>What is going on here?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Buhdumtssss"> /u/Buhdumtssss </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iqy81o/re_the_fence_around_the_capitol/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iqy81o/re_the_fence_around_the_capitol/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Alright y&#39;all, the CBA - the collective bargaining agreement aka the contract with the police union - is here and being brought before city council this Monday. It was previously discussed in a committee meeting last Wednesday where several council members were concerned about being left out of the conversation with the Denver PPA. According to the city charter, a city council representative is supposed to be involved in negotiations from the beginning but because of the current political climate, the Denver police union &quot;accidentally&quot; left them out and kept early stages of negotiations internal and private. </p> <p>Despite this, the city council committee members at Wednesday&#39;s meeting decided to send this to the floor of the city council so all city council members could vote on whether to approve the contract or send it back for arbitration. The most glaring problem with the proposed contract is that it is a two-year contract rather than one. It essentially says that Denver police will not take a pay raise or holiday bonus in 2021 but they are ensured a 2.77% salary increase in 2022. </p> <p>We ALL need to be calling and emailing our city council representatives and urging them to send the CBA back for arbitration. We know cops do not deserve this raise. And city council members know that the collective bargaining agreement was not done in good faith; it was NOT collectively discussed. Play into their egos and ask them to reclaim their power on our behalf. And sign up for public comment to speak and tell the whole council what you think! Public comment signup is today at noon and slots fill fast:</p> <p><a href="https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_3GN7Zv99SluXrlm4UC8NLQ">https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_3GN7Zv99SluXrlm4UC8NLQ</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/antitruncher"> /u/antitruncher </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iqt2fa/city_council_this_monday/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iqt2fa/city_council_this_monday/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>
