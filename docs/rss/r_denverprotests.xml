      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Please see our <a href="https://mailfence.com/pub/cal/denverprotestsdaily?a=1">new calendar</a> for the most complete list of upcoming vetted events. </p> <p>Events are color coded as follows:</p> <ul> <li>red: rally/protest/march</li> <li>purple: campaign (an event allowing activity spanning across several days)</li> <li>blue: government meeting</li> <li>yellow: education/training</li> <li>green: news</li> <li>orange: panel</li> <li>black: vigil</li> <li>pink: mutual aid</li> </ul> <h1>Wiki</h1> <p>To avoid repeating too much information from day to day, we&#39;ve created the beginnings of a wiki <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/wiki/index">here</a>. Your feedback is much needed, as this is my (TaroPeril&#39;s) first experience with a reddit wiki. It contains links to livestreamers, your rights as a protestor, and more.</p> <h1>News</h1> <p>To be added through the week.</p> <h1>Notable Events</h1> <h3>September 4 - September 7</h3> <p><strong>5:00 PM (4th) - 10:00PM (7th)</strong> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/315043063257008">We Are Mad As Hell</a> (Facebook event)</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> Anon Resistance Movement</p> <p><em>Location:</em> Colorado State Capitol</p> <p><em>Host-provided information:</em> Police in America still find themselves unaccountable for senseless murders across this country. They see themselves as judge, jury, and executioner with total impunity. We still have not seen justice for Elijah McClain, Paul Castaway, Breonna Taylor, Tamir Rice, Alton Sterling, Philando Castile, Mike Brown, Daniel Shaver, Eric Garner, John Crawford &amp; so many many more names before and after the murder of George Floyd this May. A murder that sparked that nationwide protest that will reach Day 100 this Friday Sept 4th. Since George’s heinous murder we have seen an increase of police aggression like never before, and even more embolden murders by those who stand firmly behind a thin blue line. Our voice have seem to go unheard over this summer, therefore let us make them loud and clear. Let us fill the streets with numbers that dwarf the beginning of this movement for the 4 day weekend, starting on Day 100. This time lets make it clear. We want Freedom! We want Justice! This is a peaceful family friendly weekend of protest, however with both increasing police aggression on even the most peaceful of events coupled with far right wing agitation please bring what you need to keep you and your family safe. Come and leave in groups, and have a pre planned exit route. This should be standard practice for any type of event. Again though this is a peaceful event with the recent events that have occurred in Denver over the course of August, it is important that we show up and show that Denver can still be peaceful. A Peaceful weekend will also increase our numbers through out the 4 days This is a community sourced event that evolved out of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iks9gv/sept_47_laborday_weekend_not_much_going_on/">community discussion</a> on <a href="/r/denverprotest">/r/denverprotest</a> on reddit, therefore we need your help to make this a big event and a successful one.</p> <p><em>Type of Event:</em> Protest</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <h3>September 7</h3> <h2>Denver</h2> <p><strong>3:00 PM - 5:00 PM</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/melanatedmic/status/1302306985551958016?s=21">Melanated Mic Night</a> (Twitter Post)</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> Community-organized</p> <p><em>Location:</em> Greek Ampitheatre at Civic Center Park</p> <p><em>Host-provided information:</em> Melanated mic night gives a voice for this melanated table.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We cannot let this all stop with the snow on Tuesday. We need to change our game up. I believe we do not need to make the mistakes of others. I think it’s truly important that we do our fighting for our freedom in the fall and the winter. The Great Eviction Crisis is coming! As I’ve said before my black and brown family are the first to be evicted and the last to be rented to. However I will not tread on my white working class family! When black and brown get freedom working class whites will get freedom.</p> <p>It’s past time that we consistently move our resilient homeless family members when we find out about an upcoming sweep! </p> <p>Yes protest indeed. However we must do this the same yet differently. </p> <p>Instead of constantly bailing people out, keep your folks safely on foot. Use that money to buy cheap loaves of bread. Cheap peanut butter/jelly/meat/cheese. Then put them to work.</p> <p>Bring books to read. Read to them. Enhance them. Then the community will see it. Those whom are asleep will see it. </p> <p>Then the pork/corporate masters will be angered. They will sick their government dogs on the people whom are building community outside of the capitalist monster power!</p> <p>The image means a lot.</p> <p>Those whom ask why don’t you help them yourselves or I wish their was an idea.....Will then be angered that those whom were improving the community were prevented from solving the problem.</p> <p>Not all, but many of those people will show anger towards their government/corporations.</p> <p>During the fall/winter we distribute painful but true propaganda. </p> <p>Then when spring/summer comes you’ll have a furious city/state! </p> <p>From now until next may, the US is expecting over 30mil evictions. That doesn’t include foreclosures!</p> <p>During all of this we’re preparing for a defensive general strike. We need to be in direct communication with unions here.</p> <p>Agitation Comrades! Use the winter pain to preheat the summer!</p> <p>We need people of all professions or trades. If you’re a coder: You’re needed! If you’re a teacher:You’re needed. If you’re an Uber driver:You’re needed. If you’re just good at making people smile:You’re needed!</p> <p>There shall be no overlords. We shall not engage in worthless and foolish social media battles(Fuckery). </p> <p>If you have strong religious beliefs, use the Unity that those books endorse. The teachings that say it’s not our right to have an opinion on someone’s life if they’re not oppressing! </p> <p>Anyone whom endorses division amongst the working class people for their own personal interest shall be excommunicated!!!!!!</p> <p>We need committees and sub committees. Checks on checks. If you’re not for the rainbow coalition then you’re for yourself!</p> <p><a href="https://griid.org/2011/08/03/this-day-in-resistance-history-%E2%80%93-the-chicago-eviction-riots/amp/">https://griid.org/2011/08/03/this-day-in-resistance-history-%E2%80%93-the-chicago-eviction-riots/amp/</a></p> <p>Ichi, Ni, and San</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Imaginary_Goat6464"> /u/Imaginary_Goat6464 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/inwjc2/take_it_into_the_fall_and_winter/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/inwjc2/take_it_into_the_fall_and_winter/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>
