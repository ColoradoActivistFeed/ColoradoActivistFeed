      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>With the storming of the US Senate on 1/6, there&#39;s been a lot of people calling for social media to ban protestors on the right, and for congress to pass new domestic surveillance laws. But when they go after the right, they also always come after the left as well. Case in point <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/01/22/twitter-suspends-antifa-accounts-with-over-71k-followers/">https://nypost.com/2021/01/22/twitter-suspends-antifa-accounts-with-over-71k-followers/</a> Remember when they banned the donald, but then took down ChapTrapHouse? They&#39;re going to do that every time.</p> <p>Colorado is pretty small compared to the coasts, and our local organizers primarily use Facebook to coordinate. This is just a warning to have a backup plan for communication, and not to fan the de-platforming flames, because it&#39;s going to come back and bite left in the ass.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/pinkottah"> /u/pinkottah </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/l5qhne/social_media_companies_are_coming_after_the_left/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/l5qhne/social_media_companies_are_coming_after_the_left/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>A List of Mutual Aid Groups in Denver - A Place to Start if You Don&#39;t Know Where To Start</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The following is a list of organizations, affiliations, coalitions, journalists and other groups, their socials, a brief description from their bio or site, and maybe a little editorializing by me. This is by no means an exhaustive list. This is only the list of organizations who responded to my tweet and gave permission to be listed.</p> <p>Although the outside world isn&#39;t really aware, Denver has quite the bustling mutual aid/protest scene. It&#39;s particularly insular and paranoid, but with good reason. Although fragmented and spread thin, it does actually accomplish a significant amount across the city.</p> <p>Most if not all of these groups, are looking for help however they can get it. be it money, donated items, or more pairs of hands and boots on the ground. All of these organizations are doing great work in our community, and most are happy to accept new volunteers, even if you have no prior activism experience. Many of these groups have volunteer signup forms on their site. If not, you can message them or just show up at an event and ask to help. You also don&#39;t have to only be part of one group, in fact, I would encourage working with as many different groups as you can. This builds solidarity and strengthens our coalition.</p> <p>Another very important point is that none of these organizations are better than each other, none are better praxis. This is what is meant by a diversity of tactics. A person with social anxiety might not be able to work the table at the food bank, but could help out cooking or transporting. A wheelchair bound person might not be the best frontliner against cops, but they might make a great comms person. Your aunt might not be into punching nazis, but she might be into phone banking and annoying city council members. It all helps. From each according to their ability.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><strong>----=---=--=-Resources-=--=---=----</strong></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Denver Protest Digest-----<a href="https://www.instagram.com/denver_protest_digest/">Instagram</a>---<a href="https://linktr.ee/DenverProtestDigest">Linktree</a></p> <p>&quot;Reposts protest event info, mutual aid opportunities, local resources, and more ways to get involved in activism.&quot; - - - Although they don’t always catch everything, they get most of it.

      <title>Lauren Boebert&#39;s Buddies</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/l336pp/lauren_boeberts_buddies/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Rep. Lauren Boebert CO-03 is connected to multiple far-right militias in Colorado.</p> <p>Working with the network of lovely people from <a href="/r/DenverProtests">r/DenverProtests</a>, I was able to get some intel that would further distinguish her from a congresswoman to a potential threat. She gave tours to large groups prior to the Jan 6 attack. She has multiple tweets citing, &quot;Today is 1776&quot;, roughly a few hours prior to the attack. She tweeted the location of Nancy Pelosi during the attack. </p> <p><em>But let&#39;s keep going</em>. One of the main militias caught at the Capitol Insurrection Attempt, the &#39;Three Percenters&#39;. Shooters Grill, located in Rifle, CO, is owned by the Boebert family (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb1VldFpRG8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb1VldFpRG8</a>). One of the beautiful men in the picture below was arrested for the connection of the Jan 6 attack, October 2018. The &#39;Three Percenters&#39; are defined by the SPLC as, &#39;dangerous anti-government extremists&#39;. The ADL has defined them as a &#39;heavily armed white supremacist group&#39;. They don&#39;t like immigrants, Muslims, LGBT, and BIPOC. They don&#39;t believe in COVID. They believe the BLM protests were funded by Soros and the jews. </p> <p>In Colorado, from 2019 - 2020 there have been 179 incidents of hate according to the ADL:[Extremeist Murders: 1, Terror Plots: 1, White Supremacist Events: 3, White Supremacist Propaganda: 81, Anti-Semitic Incidents: 103]</p> <p>Let&#39;s go down for the known crimes of the Three Percenters Militia:</p> <p><em>Clevland, Ohio, May 2020: FBI arrested</em> <strong><em>Christian Stanley</em></strong> <em>Ferguson with charges related to an alleged plot to ambush police</em></p> <p><em>Clarence, Illinois, July 2018:</em> <strong><em>Michael Hari</em></strong> <em>and several others were connected to a Minnesota Mosque bombing in August 2017 and a failed bombing attempt against an Illinois Abortion Clinic in November 2017.</em></p> <p><em>Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, August 2017:</em> <strong><em>Jerry Drake</em></strong> <em>was arrested because he was trying to detonate a truck bomb in front of a bank downtown.</em></p> <p><em>Garden City, Kansas, October 2016: 3 members were arrested in a conspiracy to deploy truck bombs to destroy a Muslim housing complex.</em></p> <p><em>Back to Boebert</em>. In June of 2020, she tweeted, &quot;I am the militia&quot;. Boebert of course said she doesn&#39;t know the traitor Robert Gieswein. Boebert said that she respected the Three Percenters&#39; right to discuss anti-government issues. However, the problem isn&#39;t the speech itself, the problem is when they go commit hate crimes. Robert Geiswein also created another paramilitary group called the &#39;Woodland Wild Dogs&#39;. </p> <p>In the second photo, December 2019, Bobert is on the Denver Capital stairs with friends using the &#39;Three Percenters&#39; hand sign. <strong>*Now deleted from her Facebook page*.</strong> </p> <p>She goes on these QAnon conspiracy theories. She has a past with openly identifying with known hate groups. She has pictures of her &quot;&quot;constituents&quot;&quot; wearing hate group merchandise and dressed in paramilitary gear. And then those constituents are caught doing undesirable things. She has multiple allegations of helping incite the insurrection. </p> <p><strong>The good news, the FBI is starting to investigate her background. Democrat and Republican representatives are calling her out and demanding her resignation. On 1/13, 68 Colorado elected officials requested an investigation due to her ties with the insurrection.</strong></p> <p>In Colorado, we have people like Boebert who happen to be involved with the worst things. But then there&#39;s us. We demand change. We want all people to be equal. We want all people to not be afraid to go outside because of who they are. We maintain a tolerant society, by not tolerating the intolerant. I appreciate everyone&#39;s help in the time of unrest and for creating a helpful community that not only benefits us but everyone around us. Protect and develop your communities. Cheers.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/wt954czrszc61.png?width=351&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e409a37938748551f956cfcc642aef32d36b273">Boeberts Buddies {3&#37;s outside Boeberts restaurant rocking the hand gestures.
