On-Campus Protest</a> (Facebook event)</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> Disarm &amp; Defund ACPD! On-Campus Protest</p> <p><em>Location:</em> North Side of the Tivoli at Auraria Campus </p> <p><em>Host-provided information:</em> On June 24th, the Auraria Higher Education Center(AHEC) approved a new budget for the 2020-2021 school year. Unbelievably, the percentage of the budget allocated to the Auraria Campus Police Department(ACPD) actually increased, despite the fact that 65-70% of classes are completely online this semester! We in SDS find this to be an egregious waste of resources and is unacceptable. Join us at 5 pm on September 28th to demand that ACPD be defunded and disarmed! </p> <p><em>Type of Event:</em> Protest</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p><strong>6:30 PM - 8:30 PM</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/melanatedmic/status/1310284145877114880?s=20">Melanated Mic Night</a> (Twitter post)</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> Melanated Mic Night</p> <p><em>Location:</em> Fuller Park</p> <p><em>Host-provided information:</em> Melanated mic night gives a voice for this melanated table. No judgment, stereotypes, prejudice, or racism. All are welcome to join us in solidarity with all melanated humans. Bring your lawn chairs, let’s get comfortable together.</p> <p><em>Type of Event:</em> Arts/Education</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <h3>September 30</h3> <p><strong>7:00 AM</strong> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverHomelessOutLoud/posts/2003239739805969">Stop the Sweeps!</a> (Facebook post)</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> Stop the Sweeps!</p> <p><em>Location:</em> 21st and Market/Blake, and 25th and Welton</p> <p><em>Host-provided information:</em> There are two more sites where people without housing live that are slated to be swept next week. 21st and Market/Blake is currently home to about 60 people without housing - some of whom have been living for months, some who moved there recently from the 22nd st sweep or the 25th st sweep. This site was posted for a sweep the same day as residents from 25th and Arapahoe moved to this site in search of anywhere to be. 25th and Welton is currently home to another 60 or so people without housing. Most of the residents on the right of way strip on 25th have been living there for many months. Others living in the parking lot area have moved there recently after other sweeps. </p> <p>Residents of these encampments all ask the same question: where are we supposed to go?? The City has done nothing to get these people access to housing. They are not even being offered hotel rooms through the COVID FEMA funding. They are being told to either go to a shelter or go to jail. </p> <p>Come support residents of these encampments as they demand real housing or places where they are allowed to survive. </p> <p><em>Type of Event:</em> Mutual Aid</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <h3>October 1st</h3> <p><strong>9:00 AM - 11:00 AM</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/Dignity4_ALL/status/1310450176419602437?s=20">Court Support for COS Protestors</a> (Twitter post)</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> Court Support for COS Protestors</p> <p><em>Location:</em> 270 S Tejon St, Colorado Springs, CO 80903</p> <p><em>Host-provided information:</em> Fight fascism in Colorado Springs and support those who are being unjustly targeted by CSPD.
