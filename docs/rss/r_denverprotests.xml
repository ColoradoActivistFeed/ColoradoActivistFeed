This was after Aurora District Attorney Dave Young declined to file any charges against the killers, then the city of Aurora opened a sham investigation led by a former cop which was terminated because it was plainly not “independent”. Now it is up to Phil Weiser to decide whether the cops and paramedics responsible for Elijah’s death will face any criminal charges. </p> <p>But just this week, Governor Polis quietly loosened the scope of the investigation, allowing Weiser to investigate for “offenses”, not just “criminal activity” related to Elijah’s death, opening up the possibility for him to come back with watered down charges against the killers, like we saw in Breonna Taylor’s case. Polis also took out the words that suggest someone caused the death of Elijah McClain. </p> <p>Polis must think that the movement isn’t paying attention, that we’ve been subdued by the repressive arrests of movement leaders, and now he can reel back his investigation without opposition in the streets. He is wrong. Join us for an emergency action to make it clear that we are still here and we are not going anywhere until we get justice for Elijah McClain!

      <title>The purpose of GA</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/juydl2/the_purpose_of_ga/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I just wanted to say a few things about the GA that happened today that may be a bit controversial, but I have the best intentions so please hear me out. The biggest issue I have is that we spent over and hour and a half criticizing our fellow protestors. Is that the intention of GA? I understand that many people are against property destruction as a form of protest. This includes Trump supporters, instagram liberals, and apparently some of our own as well. I also understand that some people prefer we not be agitators. But at the same time should we really be telling other protestors what to do? Isn&#39;t trying to stop them mean suppressing their freedom of speech, just like the police do to us at every protest (peaceful or not)? I guess I never know what to expect from GA, but it was just tough to sit through a hour and a half of my allies ripping through my other allies (and really behind their back in a way). Ultimately I want more people showing up to protests and I feel like all this &quot;peace policing&quot; is doing the opposite. Again, is that the intention of GA?</p> <p>My solution? I think GA&#39;s should be almost entirely about future actions and actually ENCOURAGING people to come out. Even if its instagram liberals, it still gives us greater numbers, and ultimately those half-ass protestors will be affected by our leaders narratives. If you disagree with that idea, do you want people who are more &quot;intense&quot; to organize separately then? Again just trying to have an honest discussion. Is it crazy to think we should have a more positive energy when it comes to dealing with people who actually agree with us at the end of the day?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SwimPhillips"> /u/SwimPhillips </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/juydl2/the_purpose_of_ga/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/juydl2/the_purpose_of_ga/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>City of Aurora files public court denial of wrongdoing in Elijah McClain case</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><a href="https://kdvr.com/news/local/city-of-aurora-files-public-court-denial-of-wrongdoing-in-elijah-mcclain-case/">https://kdvr.com/news/local/city-of-aurora-files-public-court-denial-of-wrongdoing-in-elijah-mcclain-case/</a> </p> <p>AURORA, Colo. (KDVR) — Attorneys for the City of Aurora filed recent court paperwork denying responsibility for the death of Elijah McClain.</p> <p>“The death of Elijah McClain is a tragedy; however, this tragedy was not caused by any acts or omissions of the (Aurora Police Department) Defendants. APD Defendants deny that they used excessive force on Mr. McClain in violation of the Fourth Amendment, that they denied him equal protection of the law under the Fourteenth Amendment and that they caused his death by batter or neglect,” a filing in federal court said.</p> <p>The scheduling order, filed in late October, also claimed officers were “justified” in stopping McClain as he was walking home and in their use of the carotid hold, a subduing technique that is now banned by the City of Aurora. </p> <p>It also denies wrongdoing on behalf of the Aurora Fire Rescue paramedics who sedated McClain with ketamine before he died.</p> <p>A coroner who ruled McClain’s death to be undetermined said his rough interaction with police and the ketamine administration could not be ruled out as contributors to his death.</p> <p>The Aurora Fire defendants “deny any negligent, intentionally tortious, or otherwise unlawful conduct in connection with their treatment of Plaintiff McClain on August 24, 2019. At all times relevant to the allegations…all actions by defendants…were conducted in good faith and with the believe that their actions were lawful, reasonable, and consistent with their duties and obligations as firefighter paramedics for the City of Aurora under local, state, and federal law and regulations,” the filing stated.</p> <p>The City also argued that some defendants could be entitled to use the defense of qualified immunity, that they were unaware that their actions may have been a violation of a plaintiff’s rights.</p> <p>“All of them murdered an innocent young man, and yet, they say, ‘It’s a tragedy,’ but none of them were responsible for it. Well, that’s a lot of BS,” said Mari Newman, the attorney who represents McClain’s family.</p> <p>Newman laid out her arguments in the same filing, as well as estimates for the amount of financial damages she hopes to seek on behalf of the McClain family. The medical costs totaled close to $250,000, and she estimated the losses of McClain’s future earnings could be as high as $3.5 million.</p> <p>“These calculable damages are the tip of the iceberg,” said Newman, explaining that there are likely tens of millions of dollars in other damages she hopes to collect for his family’s emotional losses and the experience McClain endured during the incident.</p> <p>“The biggest thing, I think, is the emotional pain and suffering that Elijah went through as this 18 minutes of torture unfolded. It’s not like it was just sort of a quick and painless death. It was a prolonged and petrifying experience where he knew he was going to die, and he was begging for his life,” she said.</p> <p>Newman also said she would be seeking punitive damages.</p> <p>“We recognize the tragic nature of the death of Elijah McClain. However, the city disagrees with the broad characterizations expressed in the lawsuit, including some that are completely unrelated to the facts of this case,” said Michael Bryant, a spokesperson for the City of Aurora. “The statements in the scheduling order, which is a required filing in all federal cases, are based on a legal view of this matter relying on applicable laws and court decisions. A critical review of our organization is underway and we have made, and will continue to make, changes to how Police serve all people in our city that are responsive to what the community wants and deserves. Because of the ongoing litigation, we are unable to provide further information about the city’s legal actions in this case.”</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kellypell"> /u/kellypell </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/jtyolv/city_of_aurora_files_public_court_denial_of/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/jtyolv/city_of_aurora_files_public_court_denial_of/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I often put the television on. I live alone, for the most part, with my cat. My kids drop by when they can. I have turned into an empty nester. The pandemic has left me without employment since March. You could say I am going a little stir crazy. There is one thing I have always valued. My education. There was a time, in the world, that an educated woman would not be welcomed. Tonight I watched Saving Capitalism on Netflix. I was highly suspicion because capitalism has screwed me over. With the heels of the election fresh on everyone&#39;s mind this is a beautiful reminder. It is time to put politics aside. Robert Reich is probably shorter than me- and I am short at 5’3”. He explains economics in a way that is more palatable that most econ professors. It is dull. For years middle class Americans have been hurting. I am one of them. I am sure if you are reading this you are too. I am not some crazy ultra liberal or conservative. Like most people in America, I lay somewhere in the middle. It is time for change on many levels. The biggest one that will have the biggest impact is corporate America. Subsidies is a term for corporate America. It is taxpayers money going to corporate America. When a corporation needs help they will ally for a grant or a loan. It will create job growth and industry stabilization. Google it. Go ahead. Take the time. It is corporate welfare. When it comes to corporations the time has come for America to shun them. Corporate America is ruining America. They can now buy politicians. This includes pharmaceuticals. It is time to redefine America. It will personally be hard for me because I love some of the biggest things about corporate America. But supporting small businesses will not only help me ween off corporate America. It will help my community. Ethics is something that has been buried deep and it is time to find them again. Stop and think about who you work for. If we all walk away from these giants they will have no more minions. Seriously. Think about it. How many CEOs get payouts at the end of the year for performance? Too many. Corporations are the reason you do not have a voice. There had been a study about it. Stop blaming politicians. Without corporations they would be nothing. I have two challenges for every American. First challenge: Demand that politicians stop taking corporate donations. In fact, it is time to hold them accountable to who keeps them in office. Demand that they have clear, readily accessible, list of donors. If they do not- they DO NOT DESERVE your vote. No debate. Second challenge: Create a boycott within your community! Find one corporation that you can purge from your life and share it. More if possible. It is time to send them a message. You can pay people reasonable living wages, if shareholders, executives, and others get reasonable salaries. The time for wealth hoarding has come to an end. Remember Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party? They wanted the same thing. Corporate America to be held accountable. These 2 simple steps we show American it is time for change. Change starts with you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/alaskagirl_amm"> /u/alaskagirl_amm </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/jt8qas/time_to_start_a_movement/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/jt8qas/time_to_start_a_movement/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

Community leaders will be demonstrating how to make survival items for the unhoused while I curse about how unnecessary this should be and demand that City Council press Hancock for #SolutionsNotSweeps in the 2021 budget, the first step to #defundthepolice and reallocate precious dollars to be invested in community SOLUTIONS.<br/> <em>Type of Event:</em> Mutual Aid</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>6:00 PM - 7:00 PM</strong> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/848905575513773">November Vigil at GEO</a> (Facebook event)</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> AFSC &amp; Coloradans For Immigrant Rights, ACLU Colorado, Colorado Freedom Fund, and Colorado People’s Alliance </p> <p><em>Location:</em> 3130 Oakland St, Aurora, CO 80010 </p> <p><em>Host-provided information:</em> With the recent outbreak, COVID 19 threatens the lives of everyone imprisoned. #DetentionIsDeadly. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s decision to return to business as usual and its GEO detention center in Aurora are not keeping our community safe, and experts agree, the only answer is to #FreeThemAll. Just last month, Dr. Carlos Franco Paredes called for compassionate humanitarian release of all imprisoned people. Join us Monday, November 9th at 6:00 pm at 3130 Oakland in Aurora for a Caravan around the detention center and virtually on FB Live. We will hear from family and impacted individuals and from the Colorado Immigrant Freedom Fund about how your donations can free our people! This event is brought to you by the American Friends Service Committee, the Colorado People’s Alliance, the Colorado Freedom Fund AND the Immigrant Freedom Fund of Colorado. </p> <p><em>Type of Event:</em> Vigil</p> </blockquote> <h3>November 14</h3> <p><strong>1:00 PM</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/TogetherW3Can/status/1325542038440304641">Womxn March</a> (Twitter post)</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> Community-organized</p> <p><em>Location:</em> Greek Amphitheater (150 W 14th St, Denver, CO)</p> <p><em>Host-provided information:</em> All womxn for change, speakers are all BIPOC women</p> <p><em>Type of Event:</em> Rally</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/denverprotestsdaily"> /u/denverprotestsdaily </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/jqq14e/whats_happening_november_9_15/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/jqq14e/whats_happening_november_9_15/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>
