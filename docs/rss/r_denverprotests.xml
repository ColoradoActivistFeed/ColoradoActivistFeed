I&#39;ve called the manager to inform them that this messaging has no place in our community and that it doesn&#39;t send a positive message concerning their branding. The manager was very kind and sympathetic to my concerns and said she would forward those concerns to the chief.

      <title>Rotational leadership!</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ji193n/rotational_leadership/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Many good people have been forced out of the movement due to the fears of infiltration. So much secrecy that it‚Äôs actually become more of a detriment. I‚Äôve also noticed that the same faces are usually leading or are always in the forefront. THIS IS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE! There should be constant planned rotational leadership. That‚Äôs for groups and subgroups. When you have a continuous leader(s) it‚Äôs easier for the pork to infiltrate or even use said leader(s) as a tool. Many of us are in direct contact with a snake(s). There is also the power and following that a leader(s) gain. This a long destabilizes a movement even more than the pork could. </p> <p>Also: Non violence solves nothing. You don‚Äôt have to start a fire to burn down a house. You stop the house from continued maintenance. In short you destroy the flow of money to corporate entities. They will hopefully collapse and burn from the inside. As I said you don‚Äôt have to start a fire for a house to burn down. You organize an armed defensive(not offensive) general strike. You never look for trouble. But when trouble comes you deal with it accordingly. This cannot happen correctly unless there is rotating leadership.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Bat_Forsaken"> /u/Bat_Forsaken </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ji193n/rotational_leadership/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ji193n/rotational_leadership/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Background information for the Public:</p> <p> The Denver Police Activities League is a 501(c) tax exempt <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/237085206">nonprofit</a>. Its stated purpose is ‚Äúto provide athletic and other endeavors to Denver youth during high-risk hours, and to be a positive interface between the Denver Police Department and the community.‚Äù This is stated on all of their IRS returns, however, DPAL no longer provides the community services they previously did. In 2015 a Jake Schroeder was hired as Executive Director, the only paid position on a nonprofit‚Äôs board. Their IRS filings show he has paid himself over 100k each year. </p> <p>DPAL went from organizing youth sports leagues for underprivileged children to taking about a dozen children to Normandy, France a couple times a year to learn about D-Day. You can read about their new purpose <a href="http://www.kyledyerstorytelling.com/2018/05/28/keeping-the-stories-of-wwii-alive-denver-pals-overlord-project/">here</a>, and the deterioration of the youth programs <a href="https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/our-colorado/denver-inner-city-youth-program-in-trouble-amid-citys-rapid-growth-program-looks-to-city-for-help">here</a>, and their shift in focus as well as the city‚Äôs decision to purchase <a href="https://businessden.com/2020/09/30/city-aims-to-pay-3m-in-federal-funds-for-nonprofits-building-in-valverde/">here</a>. </p> <p>These are not DPS students; they are from one private school‚ÄîSaint Rose of Lima. They raise their own funds to go on these trips, and DPAL purchased a lovely facility in Normandy for these bi-annual trips. They are selling their Denver facility to the city for $3 million, and while a youth center would benefit the city, the money is going to somebody who ran the organization into the ground and decided to change its mission entirely. </p> <p> DPD commanders Patrick Phelan and Ron Thomas have served on DPAL‚Äôs board since <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/display_990/237085206/2013_08_EO%2F23-7085206_990_201212">2011</a>. Phelan has been VP since that year, but left in 2019, and Thomas remains on the board. While their service on the board isn‚Äôt inherently bad or unethical, they did approve what was an outrageous expense in 2017‚Äîthe facilities in Normandy. The exact price of the facilities is not listed on their 990s, but you can take a look at them <a href="http://www.eurolanche.com/gallery.php?id=135">here</a>. </p> <p> Hancock initiated the Youth Violence Prevention Action Table (YVPAT), which has recommended the purchase of DPAL facilities. Thomas and Deputy director of public safety Mary Dulacki are both members of YVPAT. According to the Department of Public Safety‚Äôs <a href="https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/department-of-safety/about.html">website</a>, Dulacki, as the Deputy Director of Public Safety, reviews internal investigations, oversees disciplinary proceedings and other administrative matters. </p> <p>This is an enormous potential conflict of interest since both Dulacki and Phelan are listed on the deed of the same home and registered to vote at that address. They essentially each represent a party involved in the sale of a property for an absurd amount of money, while living in the same home, the address of which is easily found through a search on JeffCo‚Äôs county assessor website (<a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/3RU2FXk">redacted to prevent potential doxxing</a>)</p> <p>Request for answers from Mayor Hancock:</p> <p>This is a letter to both you and to the public to inform you of perceived improprieties in your office that I hope you will address and ameliorate. None of the information that follows was difficult to find; in fact, it‚Äôs all public records. If I can find it, so can anyone wishing to blackmail a public official. This is a matter of interest to the public and the public‚Äôs safety, and it warrants a response. </p> <p>I believe one would be hard-pressed to find opposition to the purchase by the City of Denver of a property intended to act as a youth community center. I certainly do not oppose the spirit of this action, but the former Denver Police Activities League (DPAL) facility is not the appropriate one. To close on that sale appears as though it would be to violate the agreement of the sale. Below is the conflict of interest by a city employee clause of the sale agreement. </p> <p>Seller represents that to the best of Seller‚Äôs information and belief no officer or employee of the City is either directly or indirectly a party to or in any manner interested in this Agreement except as such interest may arise as a result of the lawful discharge of the responsibilities of such elected official or employee.</p> <p>Commander Ron Thomas remains on the board of DPAL. He is a city employee, and considering DPAL has shifted from youth sports to overseas trips to Normandy, he is an interested party. Should the sale not go through, he may not have the opportunity to go to France with the organization again. Whether or not Mr. Thomas has gone on trips with DPAL in the past is not relevant because it remains a potential benefit for him to accompany DPAL to their Normandy facilities as a chaperone. If DPAL was to be dissolved, this opportunity would not exist. While it is unclear whether the opportunity was one Mr. Thomas was offered, taking experiential educational trips to France is DPAL‚Äôs primary activity, or will be once travel becomes safer. Additionally, Mr. Thomas is on the Youth Violence Prevention Table, which has recommended the City purchase the facilities. The mere fact that overseas trips are a potential benefit available to him and that he is a member of the group recommending the city purchase these facilities is enough to warrant him seeking an advisory opinion from the Board of Ethics. There‚Äôs no record of such an opinion being sought. </p> <p>How is Commander Ron Thomas‚Äô position on the Youth Violence Prevention Table which recommended these facilities be purchased and his position on DPAL‚Äôs board of directors not a conflict of interest? Why has the Board of Ethics‚Äô opinion not been sought? If this conflict has been addressed, please do inform the public, so that we do not have suspicions of unethical motivations. </p> <p>DPAL has not acted in accordance with its filed purpose for the past five years. Since 2014 the organization has slowly cut its youth sports programs due to logistical and financial reasons that were simply unavoidable if you ask executive director Schroeder. He <a href="https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/our-colorado/denver-inner-city-youth-program-in-trouble-amid-citys-rapid-growth-program-looks-to-city-for-help">mentions</a> rising insurance costs and the city‚Äôs rapid growth as being problematic for the sports leagues, but if you look at the 990s, it‚Äôs blatant that the program was choosing to allocate funds for trips to France rather than youth sports leagues. If DPAL was abiding by their filed purpose, the money from the sale would go to a good cause. However, one must ask if the funds ought to go to a nonprofit that went from serving thousands of kids through their sports programs to taking a small group of kids from one school to France a couple times a year. It‚Äôs unclear when DPAL will be able to organize such trips again, so what will this 3 million dollars fund? Maintenance and taxes on their Normandy property? Mr. Schroeder‚Äôs 6 figure salary? This increasingly looks like a charity bailout, if DPAL can even be called that anymore. </p> <p>There is a second more serious matter that is unrelated to the ‚Äúcharitable organization‚Äù that is to be flush with cash after the closing of the sale. This relates to the Department of Public Safety and the Denver Police Department. Mary Dulacki was appointed as a deputy director of public safety in April of 2019. Her position is described as follows, ‚Äúthe Deputy Director responsible for discipline of the Denver Police and Denver Fire departments. In her role, assumed in April 2019, she reviews internal investigations, oversees disciplinary proceedings and other administrative matters.‚Äù </p> <p>Mr. Mayor, are you aware that Mary Dulacki is registered to vote at the same address as one of Dpd‚Äôs Commanders? Are you aware that it is public record that she jointly owns a home with this Commander? That this Commander was previously Vice President of DPAL? Why did neither seek an advisory opinion from the board on whether it was appropriate for the individual responsible for disciplinary and internal investigations of Denver Police to be financially and domestically involved with a Denver Police Commander? </p> <p>She is also on the Youth Violence Prevention Table, which recommended the purchase of DPAL facilities. In 2014 DPAL had 23 members on its board. It currently has five, which includes Ron Thomas. Denver Police is allegedly not associated with the organization, yet a Commander remains on the Board. It seems there remains an association. The question is why? Why are two individuals who are associated or previously were associated with DPAL on the Violence Prevention Table and what impact has that had on the negotiations for these facilities? </p> <p>Please address these concerns as they are of interest to the public. Although there is likely a reasonable explanation for all of these facts, the optics are bad; and in politics, perception is everything.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Cair_Kastning"> /u/Cair_Kastning </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/jgcylz/this_is_not_okay_and_we_deserve_answers/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/jgcylz/this_is_not_okay_and_we_deserve_answers/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>
