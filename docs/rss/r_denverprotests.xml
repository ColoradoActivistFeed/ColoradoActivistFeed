      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a Denver resident, but the past few times I&#39;ve been there I&#39;ve seen a fence around areas of the capitol building along with a state trooper(s) that seem to be there 24/7. I have a few questions</p> <ol> <li>Is that fence still there?</li> <li>if the fence is there, why is it there?</li> <li>is there any push to get the fence removed?</li> </ol> <p>Obviously, that is public land and the public has a right to be there. A recent video by Cuttheplastic shows similar fences going up for no reason throughout the city. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nns1GwBX-Zc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nns1GwBX-Zc</a></p> <p>How much land is going to be restricted from the public without real justification before there&#39;s a backlash? It looks like crap, costs the taxpayers money to erect and defend, restricts freedom of movement, discourages peaceful assembly, and is all around just an oppressive message to the public specifically targeted at those who choose to exercise their 1st amendment rights,</p> <p>Like honestly, fence costs aside, how much does it cost to station a state trooper there 24/7. They must make at least $20 an hour, plus gas costs, etc. The other day I saw like 5 state police there having a fucking picnic.</p> <p>What is going on here?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Buhdumtssss"> /u/Buhdumtssss </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iqy81o/re_the_fence_around_the_capitol/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iqy81o/re_the_fence_around_the_capitol/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>City Council this Monday!</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iqt2fa/city_council_this_monday/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Alright y&#39;all, the CBA - the collective bargaining agreement aka the contract with the police union - is here and being brought before city council this Monday. It was previously discussed in a committee meeting last Wednesday where several council members were concerned about being left out of the conversation with the Denver PPA. According to the city charter, a city council representative is supposed to be involved in negotiations from the beginning but because of the current political climate, the Denver police union &quot;accidentally&quot; left them out and kept early stages of negotiations internal and private. </p> <p>Despite this, the city council committee members at Wednesday&#39;s meeting decided to send this to the floor of the city council so all city council members could vote on whether to approve the contract or send it back for arbitration. The most glaring problem with the proposed contract is that it is a two-year contract rather than one. It essentially says that Denver police will not take a pay raise or holiday bonus in 2021 but they are ensured a 2.77% salary increase in 2022. </p> <p>We ALL need to be calling and emailing our city council representatives and urging them to send the CBA back for arbitration. We know cops do not deserve this raise. And city council members know that the collective bargaining agreement was not done in good faith; it was NOT collectively discussed. Play into their egos and ask them to reclaim their power on our behalf. And sign up for public comment to speak and tell the whole council what you think! Public comment signup is today at noon and slots fill fast:</p> <p><a href="https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_3GN7Zv99SluXrlm4UC8NLQ">https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_3GN7Zv99SluXrlm4UC8NLQ</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/antitruncher"> /u/antitruncher </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iqt2fa/city_council_this_monday/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iqt2fa/city_council_this_monday/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>One of the good things about the fenced in park is that it keeps police resources, usually 6-8 officers and a couple vehicles, out of the rest of Denver. </p> <p>There are no officers or vehicles currently inside the fence (as of about 9 PM), likely due to the weather. I imagine that any quickly organized demonstrations at the fence during this quick cold snap could be interesting.</p> <p>If they insist on keeping the fence up then we can at least make them dedicate the resources to guarding it 24/7, and if the displaced homeless have to be in the cold and the wet then it&#39;s only fair that a few officers join in.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HolidayInn-Cambodia"> /u/HolidayInn-Cambodia </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ip89xe/minimal_police_presence_at_the_former_capitol/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ip89xe/minimal_police_presence_at_the_former_capitol/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>
