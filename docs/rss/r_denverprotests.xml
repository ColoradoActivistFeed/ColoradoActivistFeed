      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello comrades! I really want to do more activism and protests but alas, I have no friends (or at least none that are into activism) which makes things a little difficult for me. I have chronic pain and other illnesses so going to a protest by myself is super dangerous for me. I&#39;m looking for people to buddy up with in case my body craps out on me. If any of you comrades want to help me out please DM me. the last time I went to a protest my adrenaline kept me strong throughout but there&#39;s no guarantee that that&#39;ll be the case every time. Thank you to all the people out there fighting the good fight.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Theghostvaquero"> /u/Theghostvaquero </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/k4t260/protest_buddy/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/k4t260/protest_buddy/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll try to be short, I&#39;m trying my best to handle family without smoking 17 blunts. Currently failing. </p> <p>So in my culture when warriors battle together they became akin to brothers, when women breast fed each others children they would be bonded likewise by a shared purpose. If you have been out on the streets with us, facing the same enemy then you are my family, period. If you have washed pepper spray out of a protesters eyes or recorded the actions of our oppressors then you are my family. </p> <p>To our white family out there and those who feel pushed aside and divided off. To those who identify as socialist and those who might be labeled as antifa, to just those who just listen to nickelback every once in a while. Be patient and understanding with us, we are a wounded animal right now. Understand that what we are asking for from you is help freeing ourselves first and then help us tend to our wounds once free. This is an emotionally charged time and with the atmosphere being what it is we may lash out if we feel that the movement is not being lead by our own. It should be understandable, we are traumatized by our histories. But just because tensions are high and we disagree with certain tactics does not mean we dont love you. We need you out there with us. I&#39;m sorry for the divisions in our movement but if no one has told you you&#39;re appreciated I will. I love you all for what you put on the line every time you&#39;re out on the streets. I love the crazy helmet heads who will literally take a bullet for our family. I love the socialist who understands that the entire machine is corrupt and was designed that way. I love the melenated family out there, going against our own self-preservation instict because we cannot stop FEELING, we go against everything taught to us by showing up and demanding equality. That shared feeling, that very resilient monster called empathy is why we are out there. We win as long as we keep feeling. Every single person out there has a place.Stay angry and stay intense.</p> <p>To those that don&#39;t feel quite wanted at our events please understand that you are needed. Dont abandon us, just respect that first for our cause is stopping the ease in which our melenated family is killed. That is what we need to stop right now and acknowledging that is not saying our other demands will never be gained. We&#39;ll succeed in our lifetime but the very first thing we need is a more balanced judicial system. Militia groups might be a fucked up problem but we would like our taxpayer dollars to stop being used for our own peoples murders.</p> <p>If you are thinking that our movement is too toxic or stagnant you are not alone but please do not abandon us. Honestly this might take years but we need you for what only you can bring. If you are considering coming to an event but feel overwhelmed, we need YOU. You will bring something thing to our family that we need. I love you all, thank you for everything. Reclaim the system, take care of one another.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheHungryShaman"> /u/TheHungryShaman </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/k1hcvh/a_love_letter/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/k1hcvh/a_love_letter/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

A dogmatic way of existing at any and all protests that occur.</p> <p>Sometimes, individuals who wear black bloc engage in riotous behavior. Sometimes, they don&#39;t. While black bloc has tended to be used as an excuse to break shit and get away with it – primarily by white folks – that&#39;s not true for all individuals who engage in the black bloc tactic.</p> <p>Black bloc originated in W. Germany in 1980-81. So to anyone critiquing this tactic for primarily being used by white people, you&#39;re probably onto something since the tactic has white European origins. It came out of mass poverty that the German government refused to do anything about, and poor people decided to take action (namely through the squatters and Autonomen [Autonomist] movements).</p> <p>Property tends to get destroyed at actions when the black bloc tactic is utilized. This is partially part of the allure of black bloc. Individuals involved in black bloc actions tend to see no point in reforming a system they view as “too far gone,” so they act in ways that may ultimately lead to the destruction of the system itself (read: smashing shit). </p> <p>Now, don&#39;t get me wrong, I love some good old property destruction as much as the next person with anarchist tendencies … but it becomes a huge problem when property destruction at actions steals the limelight (read: co-option) from black and brown folks who the action was actually meant to prioritize. What do I mean? Break shit. Yes, 100%. But check your privilege on <strong>when you choose to break said shit, and consider how you breaking shit might be harming the movement for black and brown lives more than helping it.</strong> </p> <p>It seems to me that in the age of police snatching random individuals from crowds of protestors, it doesn&#39;t actually matter whether the individual they snatched did or did not engage in riotous behavior. They got got. And once the cops got you, it doesn&#39;t matter a single flying fuck whether you broke the windows of the Quiznos or if it was someone else. You&#39;re probably gonna be the one to face the consequences for that. And more often than not, these people who get snatched are black and brown. Not to say white folks don&#39;t get snatched, because they do, but obviously it is disproportionately black and brown bodies that are sacrificed and punished for engaging in political dissent. Fellow whites: we have no choice but to be better if we are going to continue operating as if we are helping in any way, shape or form.</p> <p>So let&#39;s move on from property destruction, <strong>which to be clear I am not saying is inherently wrong … just that property destruction absolutely needs to be strategic and not cause more harm than good to the movement as a whole.</strong> Ok, anyway.</p> <p>Why the hell would anyone wear black bloc and go to all the trouble of protecting their identity and trying to stay anonymous if they <strong>weren&#39;t</strong> going to engage in riotous behavior? A super fucking fair question. For the sake of transparency and possibly serving as an example, let&#39;s dive in.</p> <p>I have gone out in black bloc multiple times over the course of the summer and fall, and have not engaged in smashing shit (no matter how badly I may have wanted to at different times). I didn&#39;t start out that way, and it hasn&#39;t been every single action I&#39;ve gone to … but nonetheless, I am one of those [white] people who has worn black bloc at actions. Prior to the George Floyd uprising, I had never worn black bloc to an action. I was organizing with Extinction Rebellion Denver, doing the whole nonviolent direct action thing, and showing my face at every meeting, training, action I attended.</p> <p>But something changed for me, and I&#39;m gonna go out on a limb and say for a lot of people, after witnessing the first night of the George Floyd protests. Or, the first few days / weeks for that matter. Looking back, I think I genuinely believed we were transitioning into a completely different protest atmosphere. Walking around the streets of downtown Denver, seeing insane amounts of people out chanting, taking over the streets, breaking shit, lighting things on fire, getting tear gassed, fighting with cops … I thought the revolution was finally here. Straight up. And I&#39;m willing to accept how naive acknowledging that will make me look. </p> <p>The truth we probably all knew to be true, at least deep down anyway, is that this revolutionary moment was just that: a moment. That the feeling of revolution was fleeting. Not to say the movement is dead, because it&#39;s not. Just that, to my own and probably a few others chagrin, Denver CO is not at nor are we anywhere close to this insurrectionary / revolutionary moment we all have wet dreams about. And if that&#39;s the case, then perhaps the black bloc tactic is not necessarily viable or appropriate at this time.</p> <p>That aside, my reflection as of late is that after witnessing the war zone that downtown Denver became, I sincerely felt that it was time I started taking security culture far more seriously – from how I showed up to actions, to my online presence / use of VPNs or Tor, to leaving phones / computers / bluetooth devices turned off and far, far away when engaging in any sort of risky discussions. Incorporating black bloc was one of the main ways I tried to take this all more seriously.</p> <p>I felt that protecting my identity at actions was one of the most important things I could do to avoid getting arrested, doxxed, or otherwise targeted by police and / or fascists. And I&#39;m still concerned about those things. I saw images of protestors in Portland decked out in black bloc and tactical gear (a discussion for another time) and was under the impression that Denver needed to be more like Portland. They seemed to be this ideal that I, and many others, held up as what we should all strive for. So much so that I and many others have even made this almost holy-feeling-trek to Portland to see what they&#39;re up to and what we can learn from them and bring back to Denver. (I&#39;m aware many people outside our community have also gone to Portland to learn from them.) </p> <p>To be clear, <strong>I am not critiquing the idea of learning from other communities / movements</strong>. I am critiquing this premise that many of us seemed to have that we needed to be more like Portland, this premise that Portland was doing everything right that the rest of us couldn&#39;t figure out. And for myself, part of that was unintentionally absorbing and internalizing black bloc more as a dogma than as a tactic. I think this is a common occurrence – conflating tactics with dogmas – and in fact that was an issue I saw in Extinction Rebellion in regard to nonviolence and that we all talked about quite a lot. <strong>Any tactic will become a problem when it transcends that form and becomes a dogma</strong>. At least that&#39;s how I feel.</p> <p>And I do think that this movement has a place for black bloc to be used as a tactic. At least, I think it probably will eventually. But for now, I&#39;m not sure we&#39;re there yet. There&#39;s still so many people who either don&#39;t know what black bloc is or who have some serious concerns about it. Where we stand today, wearing black bloc may put individuals who do so at a higher risk of arrest by targeting themselves as “ungovernable” or “anarchists” to cops. And more than that, it seems to me that right now <strong>what is needed is the ability to build trust within the local [protest] community</strong>. And I think perhaps I and some of my comrades have impeded that trust-building process by trying to force the black bloc tactic onto our local situation. </p> <p>Thanks for reading if you made it the whole way through. These are just some beginning thoughts of mine on the use of the black bloc tactic. My perspective on this has been evolving pretty consistently over the course of the last few months, and particularly over the course of the last few weeks. I&#39;m hoping we can engage in some kind of “community discussion” (remembering that online discussions aren&#39;t substitutes for real-ass community) about this topic. If you super disagree with me, that&#39;s cool and you&#39;re allowed to and I&#39;d love to hear what you&#39;re thinking. If you agree with me entirely, that&#39;s also cool. If you think I missed some crucial points, you&#39;re probably right and I&#39;d love to hear them.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lochjessnewm"> /u/lochjessnewm </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/jxv4c8/an_open_letter_to_denver_regarding_black_bloc/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/jxv4c8/an_open_letter_to_denver_regarding_black_bloc/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Fences are ugly, it&#39;s time to beautify our city with our expressions of pain</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Beginning on &#39;Consumerism Friday&#39; aka &#39;Black Friday&#39; all members of the community are encouraged to come to put up art on the fence around Veterans Memorial Park located between Broadway, Lincoln, Colfax and 14th St. Before the erection of a barrier fence this summer, over 300 people were living in the park. For the last 5 months fences have been the response to calls for reallocating funds from the police to agencies designed to provide social services. The Gov and Mayor respond with fences and violence. Now is the time to create a visual statement, to remember our pain and loss and to send 2020 out with a finger to the face. Let&#39;s make Denver beautiful by turning these fences into memorials for those that left before us.<br/> This memorial could be continued through New Years and even expand to the excess of 50 locations where fencing and distances between us are the new solutions to communicating and working through our problems. </p> <p>When at the fence, please be considerate of Covid responsibilities as elders and at risk populations share space in community.<br/> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1271684576538967">https://www.facebook.com/events/1271684576538967</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cuttheplastic"> /u/cuttheplastic </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/jxq4dt/fences_are_ugly_its_time_to_beautify_our_city/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/jxq4dt/fences_are_ugly_its_time_to_beautify_our_city/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>
