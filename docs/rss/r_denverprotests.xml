      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve seen several posts on here commenting about the inadequacy of the proud boys and DPD this past weekend and that sort of wittiness needs to be broadcasted at the highest level. </p> <p>We live in a new world of information dissemination, social taboos and fine lines. What is right one day is not right the next. The media paints black and white yet almost everyone on the sidelines is on the sidelines (with a very wide degree of variance but please for the arguments sake just let me flow) bc they can’t make sense of up right left or down as they are hindered by views that keep them tenter to the center. </p> <p>Continuing to meme the absolute fuck out of the stupidity and incompetence of alt right protesters and proud boys and the DPD in their congruity handing out waters like it’s a kids soccer game and broadcasting it is the most effective non violent way for people to clearly see what the fuck is actually happening. The avenues of information have shifted and therefore the modes of fuckery must shift as well — totally NOT saying it already hasn’t — but at this time, at this moment, this close to election the harder meme will fucking win IMO. </p> <p>TLDR; let’s Willy Wonka the fuck out of this </p> <p>Point and case: trump rally where a bunch of TikTok’rs memed the absolute fuck out of the president of the United States via snapchat </p> <p>Thank you for everyone’s fight and hard work if you think whatever I said is crap at least know I still support your fight &lt;3</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/geraldquinn"> /u/geraldquinn </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ij7ya0/full_disclosure_i_am_a_lurker_but_the_best_thing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ij7ya0/full_disclosure_i_am_a_lurker_but_the_best_thing/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Denver police allow proud boy to assasult protester</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ij5pgk/denver_police_allow_proud_boy_to_assasult/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This is a follow up to a post last week, any advice would be appreciated.</p> <p>Last Sunday I attended a protest in Denver which was also attended by proud boys counterprotesting. It didn&#39;t take long for both sides to get in a shouting match with DPD in riot gear coming in seperating both sides. As this was happening in plain view of MULTIPLE officers and witnesses I was punched in the face by a Proud boy. Not a big surprise. What was surprising was the 5 officers who then tackled me to the ground while allowing my assailant to flee along with the rest of the PBs. </p> <p>I tried to get the officers to speak to with witnesses or look at the video which shows I never even raised my hands. The SGT. on duty laughed that off and I was charged with public fighting and not allowed to press charges. I spent the night in jail on what was described as outstanding warrants. That turned out to be false and the report of the night was suspiciously bare. I&#39;m currently seeking body cam footage and will update/post as soon as I can. </p> <p>I was told by the Sgt that &quot;it was good that I was being arrested, I had no reason to be out there&quot; I&#39;m sharing this because I want everyone to understand that as a brown man I do not regret a single moment of what occured, I will not be bullied by badges, titles, or militias. I love you all for everything you have been sacrificing for us, for one another. </p> <p><a href="https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=309879033574051&amp;id=904453342906421&amp;_rdr">https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=309879033574051&amp;id=904453342906421&amp;_rdr</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/voy23"> /u/voy23 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ij5pgk/denver_police_allow_proud_boy_to_assasult/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ij5pgk/denver_police_allow_proud_boy_to_assasult/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hear me out, I know that sounded like some liberal nonsense.</p> <p>So last night DPD broke out the gas fast and heavy, without any warning. Most of Washington street outside the 6th precinct was covered at one point, with lingering effects for hours. </p> <p>Obviously DPD doesn&#39;t care about us that much, but they inadvertently gassed tons of local residents who were relaxing outside on their property, and even inside enjoying the cooler temperatures through open windows. One woman told me her baby had gotten hit with the gas coming in through an open window.</p> <p>I spoke to many of the residents and at least 20 of them said they&#39;d be willing to call in and write emails to DPD and their elected officials demanding an end to gas on their street, especially if provided with a form letter or script. It&#39;s a wealthier (and let&#39;s be honest, whiter) neighborhood, and they actually do dump money into the local area. They definitely have more pull with the police and their elected leaders than we do.</p> <p>If we could successfully do that there, it could lead to more neighborhoods and areas where residents are tired of being constantly gassed while simply existing in their homes doing the same, and limiting DPD&#39;s use of gas.</p> <p>Issue is, I don&#39;t know where to even begin to organize that. Do we have any DSA or PSL reps in this sub who might be able to get the ball rolling with some kind of door-to-door campaign on those streets? I feel like have an actual organization with a face behind it would help encourage residents to follow through.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HolidayInn-Cambodia"> /u/HolidayInn-Cambodia </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iix642/emailletter_campaign/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/iix642/emailletter_campaign/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

Hear about conditions in Colorado&#39;s prisons and learn about the urgent need to reduce the number of people incarcerated during this public health emergency. A prison sentence should not be a death sentence, but that is precisely the fate that our panelists fear for their loved ones. Among others, hear from Amber Johnson, the daughter of Ronald Johnson. Mr. Johnson is a 62-year-old grandfather who relies on an inhaler to breathe. He has turned his life around in prison after being convicted of non-violent offenses related to substance abuse, but he is still years away from release. Panelists will also include attorneys involved in the lawsuit against the Colorado Department of Corrections and Governor Polis for their failure to protect our vulnerable, incarcerated neighbors from COVID-19. There are hundreds of medically vulnerable, sick or elderly prisoners who pose no threat to public safety, but who face a serious risk of dying of COVID-19 in Colorado’s overcrowded prisons.

Justice for Vanessa Guillen!</a> (Facebook Event)</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> Students for a Democratic Society-Denver, Denver Peace Council, Sanctuary4All Colorado, and others</p> <p><em>Location:</em> La Raza Park (1501 W. 38th Ave, Denver CO)</p> <p><em>Host-provided information:</em> On August 29, 1970 over 30,000 Chicanos and supporters from all over the U.S. united in East Los Angeles to protest against the high casualty rate of Chicanos in the Vietnam War. The protest also denounced the racist military draft, police brutality of Chicanos, as well as racism in general. LAPD and LASD brutally attacked the peaceful rally at Laguna Park, beating and tear gassing hundreds and arresting scores of people. The people fought back, and many police went down, as the rebellion continued on Whittier Boulevard in East LA. The police killed event attendees, Angel Diaz and Ruben Salazar. Ruben Salazar was a KMEX News Director and LA Times news reporter covering the historic event. Lynn Ward, a Brown Beret, also died during the demonstration. To commemorate the 50th anniversary of this momentous day, Centro CSO and other Chicano organizations in Los Angeles have called for a national day of action against racism, sexism, and fascism. Join us at the Colorado State Capitol on August 29th to join this national call and demand an end to police crimes and justice for Vanessa Guillen, a young Chicana whose murder is currently being covered by the US military. Guillen is just one example of many soldiers of color fooled into the dream of serving the country in order to be slain at the hands of the very people who were supposed to lead and serve. #ChicanoLiberationDay #ChicanoNationalDay #LegalizationForAll #JusticeForVanessaGuillen </p> <p><em>Type of Event:</em> Protest/Rally</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <h3>August 30</h3> <p><strong>10 AM - 12 PM</strong> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/s/denver-solidarity-ride/315130302977335">Denver Solidarity Ride</a> (Facebook event)</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Organized by:</em> Denver Solidarity Ride, Black Girls Do Bike Denver, Major Taylor CC Denver, and others</p> <p><em>Location:</em> MLK Statue in City Park</p> <p><em>Host-provided information:</em> The Denver Solidarity Rides are hosted by a collective of cyclists in the Mile High City.

Our communities too have long suffered under the knee of the racist police and white supremacy. We are now entering the third month of uprising, and demonstrations continue with no sign of stopping, demanding justice for the victims of the police in our own community and an end to all forms of racist violence. The police and their racist backers are united in their determination to put down the powerful nationwide movement that is sending shudders through the entire racist system. On Saturday, July 25, a protest demanding justice for Elijah McClain, who was murdered in August 2019 by Aurora Police, was violently attacked by two white supremacists. Protesters had taken over the highway when a Jeep broke through the barricade of cars shielding the crowd to hit the protesters. Fortunately, a driver in a truck at the rear of the crowd swerved to intercept the Jeep and slowed it enough to give protesters moments to clear the road. The Jeep sped through the scrambling crowd at top speed and exited the highway, where it pulled up behind an Aurora Police car and was given assistance. The two white men from the Jeep were not arrested and when their severely damaged car was towed, they were given a ride in a police car without handcuffs. Aurora Police confirmed they made no arrests. This attack was nothing less than white supremacist terrorism intended to halt the advance of the anti-racist struggle. Just as white supremacy resisted the advance towards equality during Reconstruction and the Civil Rights movement, so it does today. It is critical that in these moments, we stand together as a community and demonstrate our commitment to carrying forward the struggle against racism. Please join the Party for Socialism and Liberation and the Frontline Party for Revolutionary Action on August 30 for a march bringing together Denver and Aurora to demonstrate our unity and determination in the fight against racism and police violence. <strong><em>Attendees are invited to march on foot or in their cars.</em></strong> We will begin our march at the Martin Luther King Jr. Library in Aurora and march down Colfax to end at the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial at City Park in Denver. </p> <p><em>Type of Event:</em> Protest</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/denverprotestsdaily"> /u/denverprotestsdaily </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ifj3cj/whats_happening_the_week_of_august_24_august_30/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/ifj3cj/whats_happening_the_week_of_august_24_august_30/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>
